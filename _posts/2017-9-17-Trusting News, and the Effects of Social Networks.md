title: Trusting News, and the Effects of Social Networks
---
Using networks to understand trust. <!--excerpt-->

After returning from presenting at the 7th Conference on Collaborative Innovation Networks, I'm interested in looking at how trust, specifically in mass media, that is, major news outlets in America, reverberates through social networks, and how online information is disseminated in the networks. The primary question is whether trust can be modeled by social networking analysis. It was also discussed in an article *What's Left of Trust in a Network Society? An
Evolutionary Model and Critical Discussion of
Trust and Societal...*: "why is there such uneasiness about traditional media institutions on the one hand,
and a sometimes surprising trust in complete strangers on the internet? And what is the
logic behind such a seemingly contradictory situation?"(Quandt 2002)

Social networking analysis ["is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, computers or other information/knowledge processing entities."](http://www.kstoolkit.org/Social+Network+Analysis)

Is it possible to learn anything from social networking analysis about this phenomenon? Increasing polarization, as well as the "news bubble," has been documented. Research showing the decreasing relationships across the aisle in the House of Representatives was widely shared. While I'm fairly confident that it's possible to demonstrate community links and the correlated trust in mainstream media outlets, I'm more interested in seeing if its possible to identify "influencers," and produce surveys/discussions to better understand how people place their trust in authorities. We've seen that in some studies, giving partisan individuals more information doesn't change how they view the subject, but reinforces their previous beliefs. Yet what are the relationships between these news outlets and individuals? How does information flow between each source?

Question: How does the information flow, as well as online communities, formed through social media platforms affect how consumers perceive the trustworthiness of a news source? What are the primary determinants of trust concerning media outlets?
