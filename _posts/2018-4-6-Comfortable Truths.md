title: Comfortable Truths, A Recap
---



Thursday, 4/5/18, 6:30PM, On Truth <!--excerpt-->

We spoke, last night, on truth. The following is a brief recapitulation of what we discussed. Hopefully I've accurately restated various arguments and provided them with their best justifications; if not, feel free to reach out at grplansing@gmail.com to request an adjustment. Interjections are marked within em dashes. I've tried to limit my thoughts, in italics, to brief points and entries in the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html) that may provide clarification.

The intent of these written follow-ups is to connect a few key statements from our conversations to previous philosophical work directly. For those interested, it will help place current thought within the history of philosophy, and connect you with further resources that will clarify/refute thoughts. Let me know if it is helpful/not, or if the format should be adjusted.

**w/r/t the nature of truth:**

Truth is largely staid, like a stylebook for journalists. It is written down in a book, printed and disseminated to each shop. It is up to the editors to pick which guidelines to write by, and journalists demurely subscribe to its prescriptions. There is no argument. Questions are referred to the stylebook. There is no argument. — MLA, APA, Chicago/Turbian, Harvard? — It depends on the shop. Various stylebooks exist, but not within one shop. — new editions? — Then the truth changes, in accordance to what is stated in the stylebook. There is no argument.

*This comment relates to a [Pragmatic Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#PraThe) and to some extent [Coherence Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/), as I best understand it. It could be a limitation of the analogy, but it also gives weight to a [constructivist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-construction-naturalistic/) perspective of knowledge and raises questions about the relation of power to truth.*

"Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” [John 8:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A32&version=NIV)

*[Context helps](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8&version=NIV). [Dostoevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Inquisitor) immediately came to my mind. A comment was made, partly in jest, '[work will set you free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeit_macht_frei).' These remarks hinge on the definition of freedom, albeit to different ends; to my understanding, it is interpreted similarly within [The Myth of Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus).*

The concept of generally accepted truth. 

*I took this to mean that it may not be empirically provable, but enough people agree on it that it becomes institutionalized. Similar to social norms. Worth thinking about the process here.*

----
Foundational truths are necessary for social relations. Individuals can hold varying principles, and disagreements are possible, but conversations need to operate within the same framework/on shared definitions.

*Further questions I find interesting from this comment: how do these foundational truths emerge? Should we try to find the maximum number of foundational truths? Or should societies try to operate on the minimal number of foundational truths necessary? For either answer, what does that say about how societies are organized, i.e., ramifications of this belief on political/economic/cultural institutions? Is it alright if foundational 'truths' aren't actually true, as determined by facts, if they contribute to a safe, happy, and productive society?*

----
Asking "what is true" is equivalent to asking "what is."

*Take note of the [Deflationary Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-deflationary/).*

----
Radical honesty isn't necessary. Even if Christianity isn't true, it provided a moral compass on how to live.

*The general agreement was that the value of being truthful is affected by 1) intent and 2) effect. Being truthful out of spite is not necessary, and 'white lies' are acceptable for human relationships. The decision to be truthful is also affected by the perceived results of a comment. If a belief is beneficial, then it is worth holding, even as it may not be proven. My general take-away here was that truths are often self-interested. Pushback here noted that instead these would be considered principles, not truths, or that it is possible to decide through a [universal lens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIys6JoEDw).* 

Next meeting is Thursday, 4/13/18, from 6:30PM to 8:00PM.
