[Voters Not Politicians](http://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/) is currently collecting signatures for a petition to end gerrymandering in Michigan. The site does an excellent job of explaining the issue, and the initiative relies on research from the Center of Michigan, [whose maps indicate](http://www.bridgemi.com/public-sector/gerrymandering-michigan-among-nations-worst-new-test-claims) that one of the nation's largest efficiency gaps exists. For a simple explanation of what the efficiency gap is, [look here](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf). As for criticisms regarding the measure, an excellent [defense can be found here](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/08/symposium-efficiency-gap-measure-not-test/). While the EG is just an aspect of the case - still, perhaps [too complicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/does-chief-justice-roberts-fear-gobbledygook-or-is-that-just-baloney/2017/10/22/966c137c-b5ab-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html) for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court - it's interesting to take a brief look at the solutions. 

As a note, the language - of not great viewing quality - of the Voters Not Politicians' proposed solution is [accessible here](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/votersnotpoliticians/pages/174/attachments/original/1503778069/Language_WM_8.5x11.pdf?1503778069). 

The current Supreme Court case, in my opinion, will indicate the need for the proposed solution in Michigan, a citizen-led redistricting commission. Their legality aside - and while I wouldn't describe myself as an [originalist](https://newrepublic.com/article/106441/scalia-garner-reading-the-law-textual-originalism), I am sympathetic to [Roberts' sharply-worded dissent](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1314_3ea4.pdf) in this specific case - it seems necessary to wait to see whether the Supreme Court decides that measures of partisan bias [are sufficient enough](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/major-partisan-gerrymandering-cases) to demonstrate that an individual's vote is extremely diluted by gerrymandering. 

I've remarked that a motif of recent cultural issues is the question of how much is too much, and [it resurfaces here](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/03/552904504/this-supreme-court-case-could-radically-reshape-politics). Partisan advantages are practically [inevitable](http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Whitford-v-Nichol-order-on-MTD-2015.17.15.pdf) in redistricting (p.16). 

The for argument is clear. Independent redistricting committees are shown ["to have  succeeded  to  a  great  degree  (in  
limiting  the  conflict  of  interest  implicit  in  legislative  control  over  redistricting)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1314_3ea4.pdf)" (p. 33).
