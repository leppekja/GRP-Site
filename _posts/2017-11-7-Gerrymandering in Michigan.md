[Voters Not Politicians](http://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/) is currently collecting signatures for a petition to end gerrymandering in Michigan. The site does an excellent job of explaining the issue, and the initiative relies on research from the Center of Michigan, [whose maps indicate](http://www.bridgemi.com/public-sector/gerrymandering-michigan-among-nations-worst-new-test-claims) that one of the nation's largest efficiency gaps exists. For a simple explanation of what the efficiency gap is, [look here](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf). As for criticisms regarding the measure, an excellent [defense can be found here](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/08/symposium-efficiency-gap-measure-not-test/). While the EG is just an aspect of the case - still, perhaps [too complicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/does-chief-justice-roberts-fear-gobbledygook-or-is-that-just-baloney/2017/10/22/966c137c-b5ab-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html) for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court - it's interesting to take a brief look at the solutions. 

The current Supreme Court case should indicate the need for the proposed solution in Michigan, a citizen-led redistricting commission. A 2004 Supreme Court case concerning the legality of the mechanism aside - and while I wouldn't describe myself as an [originalist](https://newrepublic.com/article/106441/scalia-garner-reading-the-law-textual-originalism), I am sympathetic to [Roberts' sharply-worded dissent](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1314_3ea4.pdf) in this specific case - it seems necessary to wait to see whether the Supreme Court decides that measures of partisan bias [are sufficient enough](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/major-partisan-gerrymandering-cases) to demonstrate that an individual's vote is extremely diluted by gerrymandering before forming such a commission. 

I've previously remarked that a motif of recent cultural issues is the question of how much is too much, and [it resurfaces here](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/03/552904504/this-supreme-court-case-could-radically-reshape-politics). Partisan advantages are practically [inevitable](http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Whitford-v-Nichol-order-on-MTD-2015.17.15.pdf) in redistricting (p.16). Yet a political gerrymander may yet be decided by the court. Historically, with the Supreme court concerned about the appearance of impartiality, gerrymandering cases have been determined as political, rather than judicial questions. This point was left open to revision contingent on developing a ['manageable standard'](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/03/supreme-court-gerrymandering-wisconsin-arguments-243401), and the current Wisconsin case may or may not justify intervention. An extremely-opinionated [National Review column](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/452064/supreme-courts-partisan-gerrymandering-case-politics) points out perceived weaknesses of the Wisconsin plaintiffs' case, for those interested, and for balance, the [district court ruling](http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/sites/default/files/Whitford%20v.%20Gill%20Opinion.pdf) that disputes those weaknesses. 

If the Supreme Court refuses to intervene in the Wisconsin case, a independent redistricting committee is justifiable. Independent redistricting committees are shown "to have succeeded to a great degree (in  
limiting the conflict of interest implicit in [legislative control over redistricting)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1314_3ea4.pdf)" (p. 33). While the EG measure is limited in scope, it's not difficult to see that citizens see politicians as increasingly corrupt - even politicians [acknowledge it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/us/politics/prominent-republicans-urge-supreme-court-to-end-gerrymandering.html) - and a reorganization of districts is a reasonable aspect of a remedy, in a way that engenders competitiveness, rather than political safety. Blatant gerrymandering a [consistent failure](http://michiganradio.org/post/redistricting-michigan-new-political-maps-michigan-legislature) of the Michigan legislature.

If the Supreme Court does rule that the situation in Wisconsin is unconstitutional, then it will be interesting to see whether Democratic challengers pursue a legal avenue, or if the grassroots movement is successful in obtaining signatures. I would expect that Michigan would meet any criteria set by Gill v. Whitford. Unfortunately, I don't expect a favorable ruling; despite the belief that this is damaging to the principle of one-person, one-vote, I'm not sure if the Justices will be sympathetic to an unclear harm, the perceived susceptibility to further partisan districting cases/accusals of bias, and the minutiae of regression analysis. 

To conclude, an obligatory quote of [Federalist n.10](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp):
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.

It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.

The inference to which we are brought is, that the <b>CAUSES</b> of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its <b>EFFECTS</b>. </p>
