Section IV: Legal
Section V: Cultural

We inherently want identities. We are given identities by those around us. We sell and buy identities. We regulate these identities. From these, we have built a culture that thrives on the creation, dissemination, destruction, and renewal of identities. Our current culture reinforces the damaging effects of the above four factors of biology, society, economic system, and legal structure, and it is within our culture that we are uniquely trapped. This section will detail how cultures affect self-perception in ways not mentioned previously. When using the word "culture," I am referring to social practices (norms, religion, traditions, values), and social expression (e.g. art, music, television, dance).

A friend recently passed on a [2014 article explaining Buzzfeed's massive success online](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5730762/buzzfeeds-founder-used-to-write-marxist-theory-and-it-explains). An excerpt of the review, which is quoting an academic paper written by Buzzfeed founder Jonah Peretti, is quoted here:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
Capitalism needs people to have moments of schizophrenia, where their personal identities are in flux, but it also needs them to be able to recover from those moments with new identities, which can fuel new consumption so as to realize the identities in question. "Capitalism needs schizophrenia, but it also needs egos," he writes. "The contradiction is resolved through the acceleration of the temporal rhythm of late capitalist visual culture. This type of acceleration encourages weak egos that are easily formed, and fade away just as easily." </p>

By schizophrenia, he means "a person without a defined identity or ego."

Hence [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/), a website devoted to quizzes that aim to define who you are and who else you are like. Unfortunately, as discussed in previous posts, the business solution to America's identity problem? Simply put, "well, just give them more identities." And so far, it's been working for the capitalist system - but not for the people.

Products are not simply items to purchase for personal use; rather, purchases now act as lifestyle-signifiers, indicating your identity to everyone around you. My purchases of 3.5" x 5.5" soft-cover Moleskine notebooks (going on many years now), come with a history of the luminaries that utilize the lined pieces of paper inside. The New Yorker magazine - self-aware as always - [is laughing about it](https://video.newyorker.com/watch/shorts-murmurs-the-moleskine-artist).

At this point, I think it's only necessary to be aware of how these cultural products affect modes of perception. It's practically inevitable to involve some level of Marxist critique. As a slight digression, as seen here, when individuals find what seem to be solutions, the [culture industry](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Erandall/Readings%20W2/Horkheimer_Max_Adorno_Theodor_W_Dialectic_of_Enlightenment_Philosophical_Fragments.pdf) (p. 94) warps and twists its meaning, and [commodifies it](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/opinion/sunday/the-hidden-price-of-mindfulness-inc.html). As [this podcast](http://philosophizethis.org/the-culture-industry/) succinctly notes, its effects are practically inescapable. Yet to take Adorno at his word would be a serious mistake. The only point I wish to take from this argument to the extent that "[their dialectic of doubt prods us to pursue connections between what troubles us and what distracts us, to see the riven world behind the seamless screen.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/15/naysayers)" It's my first reading of Adorno, however, but these more extreme viewpoints allow for a mediation. [Fredric Jameson](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/jameson.htm) presents a slightly more tolerable argument. Still, it's difficult to comprehend Adorno, especially because of his language, so it may be necessary to revise this section.


Section VI: Conclusion
It is clear that these factors have strongly contributed to our self-conception.
It is a reorientation in how we utilize and communicate through a liberal, market-based system that is needed. What, however, does this adjustment look like?
