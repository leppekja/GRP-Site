title: Forming an American identity (Post 2 of 5)
---

In Progress. Arguments may change. <!--excerpt-->

As addressed in a [previous post](http://jacobleppek.org/Identity-Within-Declining-Community/), the preliminary hypothesis is that the tension between our lack of permanent self-definition and desire for such, or more broadly put, a struggle between creating certainties and accepting uncertainties, induces internal conflict. This conflict is a struggle to adapt to, or to resist, change, even as impermanence is necessary. Our environment exacerbates and limits the rate of change, as well do we; naturally, we anticipate and predict external events and effects out of our initial desire for survival, and we react and prepare in various ways to adjust for our expectations.

It is in this process that we form identities. By identities, I am referring to the collection of beliefs, personality traits, qualities, associations, and construed meanings from life experience that an individual has identified as integral to their sense of self. It is, in other words, how when asked, a person would describe themselves and their thinking, as well as in relation to others. For the purposes of this argument, I concentrate on the identities that a person is aware of; unconscious biases, for example, will be separated from this conception of identities. By associations, I mean the social groups, political parties, and other memberships; the decision to join these depends to some degree on how an individual perceives themselves, and how they want to be perceived. By construed meanings from life experience, I mean the discerned narratives that link our experience together, the identified order and significance that emerges from the events in our lives; think of this as the patterns that emerge in your behavior when faced with certain situations, that you are aware of.

These identities contribute to our sense of self. This argument builds on the conception of the self as a process, that is, always in flux; it is simultaneously being [constructed and destroyed](https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2006-7/20208/hume-personal-identity.pdf) in each moment. As a simple illustration, we find new desires, join and leave clubs, work for companies and then quit, grow old with the passage of time. Our experience is constantly changing and affecting how we [anticipate and predict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_construct_theory#CITEREFKelly1991) future events.

In other terms, it is a social or cultural identity. It is the identity of the ego forming. These identities that we create and shed as we and our environments change are merely indications of our desire to create certainties within a process of impermanence. These identities build up, providing a sense of security; in an incomprehensible world, we know who we are. Yet upon closer examination, these identities are discovered to be hollow, as the sense of self erodes, producing a sense of uneasiness and angst. It is a tension between potential and expected, the same as [Sartre's Nausea](https://libcom.org/library/nausea-jean-paul-sartre) - a decision between authenticity and living in bad faith, falling into simple societal roles for sake of ease.

In the following sections, I will (attempt to) demonstrate why we desire identities and how they form by studying how our environment encourages and reinforces conceptions of the self. To further solidify our sense of self (a process), we turn to various identities (markers of the self; or, self-branding - perhaps more appropriate for the age of social influencers).

As a note, these only serve as brief overviews, and will overlook details, but hopefully not to the point of misrepresentation. Slowly but surely, I will continue adding evidence for and against this hypothesis as I continue researching the topic. With no formal training in philosophy, hard sciences, anthropology, sociology, or psychology, please reach out with any logical errors, proposed corrections, faulty assumptions, and suggested revisions.

It is a history of how we came to be, framed by the inherent contradictions within individuals, and thus, societies, that led us here. Yet we can

Section II: Psychological

"For the egoism which enters into theories does not affect the sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is satisfied, the more robust is our belief." <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
-George Eliot, Middlemarch, p. 491</p>

We must accept that reality is at most describable, and our descriptions are further limited by our faculties. Yet these two statements, inextricable from one another, are frequently trespassed on in spite or ignorance. Moreover, our individual constraints (e.g. time, knowledge, ability) often forces a reliance on descriptions of which we do not have a complete understanding.

Descriptions, to elaborate, refer to one's knowledge and extension of their experience. They begin as [impressions](https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/Treatise.pdf), produced by the Five Aggregates, that is, form, feeling, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness (p. 13). From [Thich Nhat Hanh] (https://www.amazon.com/Awakening-Heart-Essential-Buddhist-Commentaries/dp/1937006115), "by 'form,' we mean all physiological and physical phenomena. 'Feelings' means pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings. 'Perceptions' means basic conceptualizations and naming. 'Mental formations' means psychological states that arise and manifest in us. 'Consciousness' is the function of maintaining, cognizing, comparing, storing, and remembering all the seeds" (p. 165).

Section V: Legal
Section VI: Cultural

We inherently want identities. We are given identities by those around us. We sell and buy identities. We regulate these identities. From these, we have built a culture that thrives on the creation, dissemination, destruction, and renewal of identities. Our current culture reinforces the damaging effects of the above four factors of biology, society, economic system, and legal structure, and it is within our culture that we are uniquely trapped. This section will detail how cultures affect self-perception in ways not mentioned previously. When using the word "culture," I am referring to social practices (norms, religion, traditions, values), and social expression (e.g. art, music, television, dance).

A friend recently passed on a [2014 article explaining Buzzfeed's massive success online](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5730762/buzzfeeds-founder-used-to-write-marxist-theory-and-it-explains). An excerpt of the review, which is quoting an academic paper written by Buzzfeed founder Jonah Peretti, is quoted here:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
Capitalism needs people to have moments of schizophrenia, where their personal identities are in flux, but it also needs them to be able to recover from those moments with new identities, which can fuel new consumption so as to realize the identities in question. "Capitalism needs schizophrenia, but it also needs egos," he writes. "The contradiction is resolved through the acceleration of the temporal rhythm of late capitalist visual culture. This type of acceleration encourages weak egos that are easily formed, and fade away just as easily." </p>

By schizophrenia, he means "a person without a defined identity or ego."

Hence [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/), a website devoted to quizzes that aim to define who you are and who else you are like. Unfortunately, as discussed in previous posts, the business solution to America's identity problem? Simply put, "well, just give them more identities." And so far, it's been working for the capitalist system - but not for the people.

Products are not simply items to purchase for personal use; rather, purchases now act as lifestyle-signifiers, indicating your identity to everyone around you. My purchases of 3.5" x 5.5" soft-cover Moleskine notebooks (going on many years now), come with a history of the luminaries that utilize the lined pieces of paper inside. The New Yorker magazine - self-aware as always - [is laughing about it](https://video.newyorker.com/watch/shorts-murmurs-the-moleskine-artist).

At this point, I think it's only necessary to be aware of how these cultural products affect modes of perception. It's practically inevitable to involve some level of Marxist critique. As a slight digression, as seen here, when individuals find what seem to be solutions, the [culture industry](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Erandall/Readings%20W2/Horkheimer_Max_Adorno_Theodor_W_Dialectic_of_Enlightenment_Philosophical_Fragments.pdf) (p. 94) warps and twists its meaning, and [commodifies it](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/opinion/sunday/the-hidden-price-of-mindfulness-inc.html). As [this podcast](http://philosophizethis.org/the-culture-industry/) succinctly notes, its effects are practically inescapable. Yet to take Adorno at his word would be a serious mistake. The only point I wish to take from this argument to the extent that "[their dialectic of doubt prods us to pursue connections between what troubles us and what distracts us, to see the riven world behind the seamless screen.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/15/naysayers)" It's my first reading of Adorno, however, so my comprehension is surely limited; moreover, reading his more extreme viewpoint allows for a mediation between my previous view. [Fredric Jameson](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/jameson.htm) presents a slightly more tolerable argument. Still, it's difficult to comprehend Adorno, especially because of his language, so it may be necessary to revise this section.

In conclusion, American culture reinforces


Section VII: Conclusion
It is clear that these factors have strongly contributed to our self-conception.
It is a reorientation in how we utilize and communicate through a liberal, market-based system that is needed. What, however, does this adjustment look like?
