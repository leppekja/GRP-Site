title: Forming an American identity (Post 2 of 5)
---

*In Progress. Arguments may change.* <!--excerpt-->

Note: This post is left unfinished - currently working on the subject aside this, and am putting this post aside as I clarify my thoughts on the subject.

As addressed in a [previous post](http://jacobleppek.org/Identity-Within-Declining-Community/), the preliminary hypothesis is that the tension between our lack of permanent self-definition and desire for such, or more broadly put, a struggle between creating certainties and accepting uncertainties, induces internal conflict. This conflict is a struggle to adapt to, or to resist, change, even as impermanence is necessary. Our environment exacerbates and limits the rate of change, as well do we; naturally, we anticipate and predict external events and effects out of our initial desire for survival, and we react and prepare in various ways to adjust for our expectations. Lastly - which will be addressed in a forthcoming post - this internal conflict explicitly manifests itself in the divides, discourse, interests, and culture of American society, leading to the many topical disagreements today.

It is in this process that we form identities. By identities, I am referring to the collection of beliefs, personality traits, qualities, associations, and construed meanings from life experience that an individual has identified as integral to their sense of self. It is, in other words, how when asked, a person would describe themselves and their thinking, as well as in relation to others. For the purposes of this argument, I concentrate on the identities that a person is aware of; unconscious biases, for example, will be separated from this conception of identities, for the time being. By associations, I mean the social groups, political parties, and other memberships; the decision to join these depends to some degree on how an individual perceives themselves, and how they want to be perceived. By construed meanings from life experience, I mean the discerned narratives that link our experience together, the identified order and significance that emerges from the events in our lives; think of this as the patterns that emerge in your behavior when faced with certain situations, that you are aware of.

Two special circumstances should be pointed to: the first, unconscious identities; the second, expressing identity within a state of anonymity (i.e. internet). They will be discussed in more detail later, but for explanation, I'm choosing to focus on conscious identities first, as they are easier to point out and subvert. As for the second, I'm postulating that identity markers become more extreme while the actor assumes anonymity. To this point, as actors strive to make their identities increasingly salient to others, it requires identities that are more visible, thus non-moderate positions. This is a fairly well-documented phenomenon already, but perhaps not in these terms - at least not that I've seen, so I will look into it further.

These identities contribute to our sense of self. This argument builds on the conception of the self as a process, that is, always in flux; it is simultaneously being [constructed and destroyed](https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2006-7/20208/hume-personal-identity.pdf) in each moment. As a simple illustration, we find new desires, join and leave clubs, work for companies and then quit, grow old with the passage of time. Our experience is constantly changing and affecting how we [anticipate and predict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_construct_theory#CITEREFKelly1991) future events.

In other terms, it is a social or cultural identity. It is the identity of the ego forming. These identities that we create and shed as we and our environments change are merely indications of our desire to create certainties within a process of impermanence. These identities build up, providing a sense of security; in an incomprehensible world, we know who we are. Yet upon closer examination, these identities are [discovered to be hollow](https://www.amazon.com/Civilization-Its-Discontents-Sigmund-Freud/dp/0393304515), as the sense of self erodes, producing a sense of uneasiness and angst. It is a tension between potential and expected, similar to [Sartre's Nausea](https://libcom.org/library/nausea-jean-paul-sartre) - a decision between authenticity and living in bad faith, falling into simple societal roles for sake of ease.

In the following sections, I will (attempt to) demonstrate why we desire identities and how they form by studying how our beings and environments encourage and reinforce conceptions of the self. To further solidify our sense of self (a process), we turn to various identities (markers of the self; or, self-branding - perhaps more appropriate for the age of social influencers). The following sections, *Biological, Psychological, Social, Economic, Legal, and Cultural,* are causes, aspects, and/or expressions of the desire for constants within impermanence. That is, no section is truly distinct from another.

As a note, these only serve as brief overviews, and will overlook details, but hopefully not to the point of misrepresentation. Slowly but surely, I will continue adding evidence for and against this hypothesis as I continue researching the topic. With no formal training in philosophy, hard sciences, anthropology, sociology, or psychology, please reach out with any logical errors, faulty assumptions, or suggested revisions. Really, I'm just trying to organize my thoughts - frankly, it's probably already been done better somewhere and I just haven't found it yet. Page numbers may not be exact due to ebook/edition variation, and while I've tried to find PDFs of sources, it wasn't always possible.

Succinctly put, it is an attempt to frame how we arrived here through the inherent contradictions within individuals.


## Section I: Biological
_____
Moreover, because the mind is a complex system composed of many interacting parts, it makes no sense to ask whether humans are selfish or generous or nasty or noble across the board. Rather, they are driven by competing motives elicited in different circumstances. [-Steven Pinker](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3600799/Pinker_WhyNature.pdf?sequence=2%3F)

We begin, [evolving](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-darwin-didnt-know-45637001/) and emerging, [out of chaos](https://www.amazon.com/Out-chaos-Louis-Joseph-Halle/dp/03952535780), into an [incomprehensible](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/) world with immediate survival as our perhaps [primary drive](https://www.psychologynoteshq.com/drive-reduction-theory/). The brain is highly deterministic, just like a cell's processes are automatic. The regulation of many bodily processes occurs largely [without conscious input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system).

It's framed in a few different ways, but self-preservation seems to be a universal trait in all. The fight or fight response is apparently a [physiological reaction](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fight-or-flight-response) to perceived threats; even as threats are increasingly [less obvious](https://www.livescience.com/4631-modern-humans-retain-caveman-survival-instincts.html), the [mechanism persists](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-jim-taylor/is-our-survival-instinct-_b_1588157.html). [This essay](https://public.wsu.edu/%7Etaflinge/biology.html) proposes that the influence of biology on human behavior manifests itself through "1) self-preservation; 2) the reason for self-preservation, reproduction; and 3) a method to enhance self-preservation and reproduction, greed."

With the principle of self-preservation established, how does identity contribute to survival?

The [nature vs. nurture](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/abcs-child-psychiatry/201710/nature-versus-nurture-where-we-are-in-2017) binary is an [illusion](https://www.amazon.com/Mirage-Space-between-Nature-Nurture/dp/0822347318) - but the distinction has been [practically necessary](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3600799/Pinker_WhyNature.pdf?sequence=2%3F) (p.14). It's maybe better phrased as [Nature Via Nurture](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/30/scienceandnature.features) (No luck on a PDF version. He also [published a 2015 book](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/books/review/the-evolution-of-everything-by-matt-ridley.html) on similar topics, Ch. 3, 8, 9). The consensus seems to settle around 'well, it's a mix;' a combination between innate genes responding to various stimuli and learned behaviors.  

Humans learn [through stories](https://hbr.org/2014/10/why-your-brain-loves-good-storytelling). Pertaining to societies, evidence exists that storytelling "[arose partly as a way of cementing social bonds, and instilling an ethic of cooperation](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/12/the-origins-of-storytelling/547502/)." To the individual, our minds are narrative-based (https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/courses/275f00/gover-narr.html). It links the past to the present, making sense of a set of disparate experiences to better survive in the future. In separate moments, we naturally link cause and effect, inferring from the results, remembering their implications for the future. We assume what's called the [Uniformity Principle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau): the future will be like the past.

What we consider consciousness is an emergent property.

## Section II: Psychological
_____

"For the egoism which enters into theories does not affect the sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is satisfied, the more robust is our belief." <p style="padding-left: 80px;">
-George Eliot, Middlemarch, p. 491</p>

We must accept that reality is at most describable, and our descriptions are further limited by our faculties. Yet these two statements, inextricable from one another, are frequently trespassed on in spite or ignorance. Moreover, our individual constraints (e.g. time, knowledge, ability) often forces a reliance on descriptions of which we do not have a complete understanding.

Descriptions, to elaborate, refer to one's knowledge and extension of their experience. They begin as [impressions](https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/Treatise.pdf), produced by the Five Aggregates, that is, form, feeling, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness (p. 13). From [Thich Nhat Hanh](https://www.amazon.com/Awakening-Heart-Essential-Buddhist-Commentaries/dp/1937006115), "by 'form,' we mean all physiological and physical phenomena. 'Feelings' means pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings. 'Perceptions' means basic conceptualizations and naming. 'Mental formations' means psychological states that arise and manifest in us. 'Consciousness' is the function of maintaining, cognizing, comparing, storing, and remembering all the seeds" (p. 165). This point is a foundation for many variants of Buddhism. [Hume's notion](https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/Treatise.pdf) of the relationship between impressions and ideas, I think, lies within the first four aggregates; he details how basic inputs from senses are transformed into complex objects of consciousness, rather than the other way around.

In [Why Buddhism is True](http://www.worldcat.org/title/why-buddhism-is-true-the-science-and-philosophy-of-meditation-and-enlightenment/oclc/989810980), Robin Wright dedicated a few chapters to the fusion of modern psychology and tenets of Buddhism. The book as a whole is a decent quick read, by the way. Its point is essential to this section, and Wright actually ends up at somewhat the same conclusion regarding the way forward, that is, working through the illusion of the self. He demonstrates, convincingly, that natural selection has encouraged not an accurate perception of the world, but with the perception most likely to encourage survival, resulting in many delusions.

The world is terrifying, and we hide from it. Existentialist philosophers extensively commented on this anxiety, as previously discussed, but it is the admission that these questions have to be put aside day-to-day that is the focus of this section. These day-to day assumptions also produce [social norms](https://biblio.csusm.edu/sites/default/files/reserves/giddens_modernity_and_self-identity_ocr.pdf) (Note: this topic will be further discussed in S.3).

It's interesting to see multiple theories on hierarchies of consciousness emerge from philosophers, scientists, and religions.

Let's start with [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html): from the bottom, physiological, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization at the peak. As one fulfills the basic needs at the bottom, the person progresses to the next stage. He refines the theory over a few decades, reducing the rigidity of the categories, and creating sub sections; some criticism can be [found here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/positively-media/201111/social-networks-what-maslow-misses-0)

Regardless of the weaknesses, if we can apply the pyramid model to the formation of identity, in relation to survival.
I'd place belongingness and love as an extension of safety needs.

Freud detailed the id, ego, and super-ego. In [Civilization & Its Discontents](https://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Freud-CivDis.html), he argued that "what decides the purpose of life is simply the program of the pleasure principle." It is seemingly partitioned: escaping pain, and obtaining feelings of happiness. And so life is fickle for many, oscillating between the two states, directing action.

## Section III: Social
_____

A few starting points here:

Our conception of self only exists within society.
The self and society [continuously interact](https://biblio.csusm.edu/sites/default/files/reserves/giddens_modernity_and_self-identity_ocr.pdf) and affect one another (Giddens' Theory of Structuration).

I stumbled across the concept of a ["dialogical self"](https://www.academia.edu/397669/The_Presence_of_Self_in_the_Person_Reflexive_Positioning_and_Personal_Constructs_Psychology) recently, from Tan & Moghaddam (1995), in the above source (Jones 1997 p. 456). This term describes a reflexive conception of a self, that is, paraphrasing from Jones here, interdependent on external events and inner thoughts to produce a person.

## Section VI: Cultural
____
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
We come upon a contention which is so astonishing that we must dwell upon it. This contention holds that what we call our civilization (Kultur) is largely responsible for our misery, and that we should be much happier if we gave it up and returned to primitive conditions. I call this contention astonishing because, in whatever way we may define the concept of civilization, it is a certain fact that all the things with which we seek to protect ourselves against the threats that emanate from the sources of suffering are part of that very civilization.
-Freud, [Civilization & Its Discontents](https://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Freud-CivDis.html)</p>

We inherently want identities. We are given identities by those around us. We sell and buy identities. We regulate these identities. From these, we have built a culture that thrives on the creation, dissemination, destruction, and renewal of identities. Our current culture reinforces the damaging effects of the above four factors of biology, society, economic system, and legal structure, and it is within our culture that we are uniquely trapped. This section will detail how cultures affect self-perception in ways not mentioned previously. When using the word "culture," I am referring to social practices (norms, religion, traditions, values), and social expression (e.g. art, music, television, dance).

A friend recently passed on a [2014 article explaining Buzzfeed's massive success online](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5730762/buzzfeeds-founder-used-to-write-marxist-theory-and-it-explains). An excerpt of the review, which is quoting an academic paper written by Buzzfeed founder Jonah Peretti, is quoted here:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
Capitalism needs people to have moments of schizophrenia, where their personal identities are in flux, but it also needs them to be able to recover from those moments with new identities, which can fuel new consumption so as to realize the identities in question. "Capitalism needs schizophrenia, but it also needs egos," he writes. "The contradiction is resolved through the acceleration of the temporal rhythm of late capitalist visual culture. This type of acceleration encourages weak egos that are easily formed, and fade away just as easily." </p>

By schizophrenia, he means "a person without a defined identity or ego."

Hence [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/), a website devoted to quizzes that aim to define who you are and who else you are like. Unfortunately, as discussed in previous posts, the business solution to America's identity problem? Simply put, "well, just give them more identities." And so far, it's been working for the capitalist system - but not for the people.

Products are not simply items to purchase for personal use; rather, purchases now act as lifestyle-signifiers, indicating your identity to everyone around you. My purchases of 3.5" x 5.5" soft-cover Moleskine notebooks (going on many years now), come with a history of the luminaries that utilize the lined pieces of paper inside. The New Yorker magazine - self-aware as always - [is laughing about it](https://video.newyorker.com/watch/shorts-murmurs-the-moleskine-artist).

At this point, I think it's only necessary to be aware of how these cultural products affect modes of perception. It's practically inevitable to involve some level of Marxist critique. As a slight digression, as seen here, when individuals find what seem to be solutions, the [culture industry](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/%7Erandall/Readings%20W2/Horkheimer_Max_Adorno_Theodor_W_Dialectic_of_Enlightenment_Philosophical_Fragments.pdf) (p. 94) warps and twists its meaning, and [commodifies it](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/opinion/sunday/the-hidden-price-of-mindfulness-inc.html). As [this podcast](http://philosophizethis.org/the-culture-industry/) succinctly notes, its effects are practically inescapable. Yet to take Adorno at his word would be a serious mistake. The only point I wish to take from this argument to the extent that "[their dialectic of doubt prods us to pursue connections between what troubles us and what distracts us, to see the riven world behind the seamless screen.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/15/naysayers)" It's my first reading of Adorno, however, so my comprehension is surely limited; moreover, reading his more extreme viewpoint allows for a mediation between my previous view. [Fredric Jameson](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/jameson.htm) presents a slightly more tolerable argument. Still, it's difficult to comprehend Adorno, especially because of his language, so it may be necessary to revise this section.

In conclusion, American culture reinforces incentives for self-assertion. 


## Section VII: Conclusion
_____
Identities are transitory. They arise as a result of the interplay between awareness, biology, and notions of the self. Natural selection has developed a being that is highly self-centric and focused on surviving, without thought to accurate perceptions of reality. It is clear that these factors, detailed above, have strongly contributed to our self-conception. And this isn't essentially morally wrong. Yet attachment to these identities is damaging, especially when self-value and questions of meaning emerge. 

It is a reorientation in how we utilize and communicate through a liberal, market-based system that is needed. What, however, does this adjustment look like?
