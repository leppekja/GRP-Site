The morning comes singing Allahu Akbar, and the birds listen. I hear it too, but I listen for the whistle of the teapot. The shrillness is familiar and comforting, unlike the call to prayer and city noise, carried by the breeze. I could leave it on until the water boils away. 
	
The coffee shops are empty until the evening, when the men leave work for the cards and tobacco. Next door, the abandoned lot-turned-parking lot is full. Despite the dust, the cars are immaculate and nearly touching one another.
	
At night, the wide stone steps of Darat al-Funan become seats to smoke and drink on. Usually, the narrow staircases cut between the homes and shops end in markets and busy streets; here, the steps end among trees. Taxi drivers loiter around the circle nearby. 
	
Outside of the main streets, the city is dark and the streets empty except for the parked cars. The sidewalks are rocky and uneven with trees every few meters so I walk up the center of the street. Home is up a hill, left at the al-Rawdah mosque, and just past the convenience store wedged in between the buildings.
