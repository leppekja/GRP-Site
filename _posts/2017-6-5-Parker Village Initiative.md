Revitalization in Highland Park -- starts with Parker Village, Inc.?<!--excerpt-->

We've all heard about Detroit's revitalization. Trouble is, this revitalization is condemned as benefitting only a few, or as gentrifying efforts. Furthermore, much of this redevelopment occurs in a small concentration of neighborhoods, failing to reach outer areas that are afflicted with high poverty rates. While it makes sense in some economic development strategies to concentrate on promising areas that encourage investment, it's not always appreciated by those who feel ignored.

That's why it's great to see outer areas seeking and obtaining investment for neighborhood projects.
Parker Village is an attempt to bring sustainable community projects to the forefront in Detroit. From utilizing high-tech, reusable building materials to bringing innovative ideas like aquaponics to the table, the initiative is building a community project that demonstrates the viability of many concepts that are just being introduced. 

With its sustainable model and forward thinking, it's [already getting news coverage](https://www.greeningdetroit.com/2017/04/13/parker-village-great-partners-economic-development/).
