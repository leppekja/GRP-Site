[Check out this list](http://economicdevelopment.org/category/podcasts/)

[EconTalk](http://www.econtalk.org/)
Fantastic podcast for a classical liberal viewpoint/discussion on emergent systems. Discussion-focused.

[International Crisis Group](https://www.crisisgroup.org/latest-updates/podcast)
Rotating focus on international political topics.

Incredibly interesting. May not be widely known, but great. Discussion-focused.

[How I Built This (NPR)](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this)

[Planet Money (NPR)](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money)
Personally, it's over produced - but very popular. Doesn't approach a freewheeling discussion.

*Just went on hiatus in June, unfortunately...*

[Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com/)
