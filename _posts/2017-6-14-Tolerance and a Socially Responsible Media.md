title: Tolerance and a Socially Responsible Media
---

"An open, plural society leaves the question of the absolute moral correctness unanswered and underlines as a matter of principle the impossibility of final truth." <!--excerpt-->
(16 Media & Open Societies 2000)

I'm currently reading *[Media & Open Societies: Cultural, Economic and Policy Foundations for Media Openness and Diversity in East and West](https://books.google.com/books/about/Media_Open_Societies.html?id=yT-4AAAAIAAJ)* as I apply for a 2018-2019 Fulbright Research Award. As part of the process of devising an appropriate research question, I'm developing hypotheses on this blog.

The issue, as I understand it and aim to remedy, is not that members of the public are unwilling to ensure sources of information are correct - perhaps more accurately worthy of their trust -but is that most do not have easily accessible tools to check the veracity of sources. This concept is also detailed under the [Media Project]() tab. My rough plan is to work on better understanding how to create tools which allow for citizens to improve their understanding of authoritative sources, how to connect with them, and how to confirm their findings. This is cross-cultural work, and expands on a couple of excellent projects that UNESCO has funded in Jordan, as well as the Jordan Media Institute. As soon as the application is completed (~Oct 2017), I'll be posting it here.
