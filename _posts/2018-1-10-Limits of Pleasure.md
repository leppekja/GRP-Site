title: Limits of Desire (Epicurean Counsel)
---
At times, reading philosophy divorces the search for truth from the people looking. <!--excerpt-->

I'm currently reading [The Deepest Human Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18526739-the-deepest-human-life) by Scott Samuelson, a thoroughly enjoyable introduction to philosophy. It's witty, engaging, and personal without philosophy's frequent thickly-layered abstractions. I'd place it in a category with some of Daniel Klein's work, especially [Travels with Epicurus](https://www.amazon.com/Travels-Epicurus-Journey-Island-Fulfilled/dp/0143126628?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143126628). At times, reading philosophy divorces the search for truth from the people looking. Samuelson and Klein, fortunately, relate their and others' experience in these excellent books.

Both discuss [Epicurus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/), a materialist who, among many other notions, argues the purpose of our minds is to obtain pleasure and avoid pain. While this could be put up for debate, his following distinction between pleasures is valuable, especially in a hedonistic society like ours. A liberal market-based system relies on individual desire; by nature, the stifling of self-interest is only useful to the extent that popular culture can function successfully. Divergent interests are tolerated and folded into consumer products. Desires are transient, fluctuating, providing the impetus for further development and creation.

I don't think it's unreasonable to accept that desires don't lead to any sort of lasting happiness, contentment, or joy. Experience proves this well enough, and this is Epicurus' statement:

>We must also reflect that of desires some are natural, others are groundless; and that of the natural some are necessary as well as natural, and some natural only. 

Distinguishing this isn't surprising after some reflection. Yet in practice, our perception is easily obfuscated. Desire doesn't arrive in different forms. Its intensity may vary, and the object of desire will surely change, but the thoughts and emotions that make up desire are predictable. To some extent, I think this lends a degree of credibility to everything we desire, worthy or not; in the initial grasp of the compulsion, when the pull of the object is at its zenith, it's possible to be fooled by the mind concerning the value. In daily living, the emptiness of our desires is intentionally covered up by a layer of advertising and one of cultural conditioning. Quite literally, the mission of advertising agencies is to fool you into believing a groundless desire is a necessary desire. And it works. It works all the time; even as we're aware we probably don't *need* an iPad in addition to our laptops, we still buy them.

The practice of identifying limited vs. unlimited desires provides some counsel. Thirst, for example, is mitigated after a certain amount of water. At that point, I lose all desire to drink more. With potato chips, Samuelson's example, the desire to eat potato chips isn't necessarily stemmed by my appetite. Even after I feel sick, I still eat a variety of desserts. Money in-itself is another clear example of unlimited desire.

Worthy desires, I think, can mutate quickly, especially those categorized as natural but not necessary desires. My desire for knowledge has practically translated into the hoarding of books. Reputation is an example of this, with fame being its extreme. Our natural propensity for certainty leads us to numerous cognitive biases and untrue beliefs. 

Plato's [Republic](http://www.iep.utm.edu/republic/) examines this as well in Book IX:

>Among unnecessary pleasures and desires, some seem lawless; very likely they are present in everyone, but in some people they are disciplined by the laws and by better desires in company with reason, and they can either be completely got rid of, or left few and weak. But in other people they are stronger and more numerous.

Socrates continues to criticize democracy, but I'll leave it there. This is the question that most interests me: how to teach/promote/cultivate citizens to responsibly respond to internal desire for external objects, speaking generally. Perhaps it is an individual reframing of the natural, external world as made up of objects to be manipulated to recognizing desire to be superfluous compared to adjusting one's self to meet external conditions. A cultural shift is unlikely. Norms of self-control seem to be eroding, but I can't say if that's true or not on a societal level. I have personal qualms about communicating it this way; for instance, stating that the whole is greater than the individual leads to political decisions I disagree with. Yet freedom does come with responsibility, and it does seem true that internal self-control leads to sustained contentment, rather than the obligatory and continued fulfillment of external desires, which doesn't seem much like freedom to me.

As Henry Miller states in Sexus, it would be a transposition, reborn "not separate and self-hypnotized, but individual and related."
