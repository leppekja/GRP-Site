title: Politicians and Morals
---

No, it won't get better, even if the Republicans lose. <!--excerpt-->

A day later, [Krugman posted](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/opinion/republican-tax-lies-fed.html) a piece on the "moral rot" pervading the current Republican Congress & Administration, indicating an aspect of Fukuyama's political decay.

Is integrity a value of the past? Again, Krugman's characterization of rot implies that some level of foundation once existed, that the steel beams of honesty have rusted over and the concrete has cracked. He, and others, I think, are emphasizing the wrong issue here: what's worrying is that the political foundation was never robust enough to support the weight of massive moral social divisions. In other words, the political framework doesn't allow for sustained cleavages in American society. It shouldn't be surprising that politicians are consolidating power and placing party loyalty over social benefit. In times of social upheaval, politicians respond accordingly and desperately.

A few simple examples can demonstrate this. Vehement disagreement on maintaining and expanding the practice of slavery, a social & economic issue, resulted in the American Civil War; in the lead-up to the war, an argument for states rights [developed *in response* as the justification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQeEKeBkZ8), while still enduring for certain people today, isn't convincing, nor sound. Solving the issue through political means wasn't possible; the two weights bearing down on the structure at opposite ends split in the middle, and radical means were necessary to reform the foundation. The Civil Rights movement, the 14th, 15th, 19th amendment, the response to the Vietnam War and other peace movements - each of these placed an unbearable pressure on American political structures. It seems that democracy cannot sustain social cleavages for long; release, at some point, is needed. This either happens through the removal of the cause for the pressure i.e. wars ending, reduction in the pressure i.e. topical issue moving out of public opinion, or a shift in the foundation i.e. court decision, constitutional amendment.

America has a memory problem. Frequently, a white male working class looks back fondly on the second half of the twentieth century and the post-WWII growth - it was simplistically framed, often, in terms of progress; the new normal wasn't stagnation, but steady expansion in economic and social terms. But these 50 years were [the exception](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Piketty2014Capital21c.pdf), not the norm (slide 24). Serious cultural threats to power came from abroad rather from within, and with major social advances, the stratification of society in economic terms emerged, relatively unhindered. Many current politicians recall this promise of living in comfort, of moving from the middle to upper class, and against the barrage of criticisms, those politicians seek to return to an America they knew, a simpler America. In the midst of a readjustment of power dynamics, politicians are acting as they always have: desperately attempting to retain their influence.

We've increasingly relied not on a consistent moral foundation, but on consistent political institutions, in American government. It is the aspect of consistency - in general, that all those in power had many of the same assumptions - that allowed for sustained collaboration across competing interests for non-existential issues. With the end of the post-WWII boom, the whole of American society now faces issues that only minorities dealt with previously (This isn't to say that those issues are of equal severity, which is the mistake that many white nationalists are making now. Just a taste of the longstanding social pressures and responsibilities of women, African-Americans, and other minorities is so foreign and repugnant to this segment of the population that rejection is a preferable approach to acceptance.) Our political institutions, those that informally regulate bipartisanship and compromise, fail when tested. There is no incentive for politicians to abide by such institutions, especially with re-election at stake.

In conclusion, it's not surprising that political institutions have rapidly collapsed, and the Republican's recent actions on the tax bill are indicative that what Krugman identifies as moral rot has its roots outside of politics. The focus, however, needs to be placed on how we ensure political bodies continue to operate despite widespread social divisions. With different basic assumptions on what society should look like, what is the minimum level of shared moral values necessary for cooperation to continue?

P.S.

On 12/7, [another interesting op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/opinion/liberals-conservatives-trump.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region) was posted, especially Karen Stenner's arguments. The second half of the piece didn't present anything new, but Stenner's description of the unsettled core tenets in American democracy was a strong point to make. I just quoted a few paragraphs here as follows:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
"“Libertarians and/non-authoritarians,” Stenner writes,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
'are likewise aroused and activated under these conditions, and move toward positions of greater racial, moral and political tolerance as a result. Which increases political polarization of the two camps, which further increases normative threat, and so it goes on. This is what I mean by the core elements of liberal democracy creating conditions that inevitably undermine it.'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15px;">
How does the undermining process work?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
'A system like our ideal liberal democracy, which does not place any constraints on critiques of leaders, authorities and institutions; and does not allow any suppression of ideas no matter how dangerous to the system or objectionable to its citizens; and does not permit itself to select who can come in, or stay, based on their acceptance/rejection of fundamental liberal democratic values, has both:

(1) guaranteed perpetual generation of conditions of normative threat, and all the activation, polarization, and conflict that that produces, and

(2) disallowed all means for protecting itself against that “authoritarian dynamic,” which otherwise might have included allowing: some selectivity in regard to the fundamental values of those who are allowed to come, and to stay; constraints on certain kinds of critiques of leaders, authorities and institutions; constraints on free speech that exclude racist or intolerant speech; some ability to write moral strictures into public policy to reflect traditional beliefs where the majority “draws the line.”'</p>
<p style="padding-left: 15px;">
If a liberal democracy were to allow those things, it would no longer be a liberal democracy. But if it does not allow those things, it is extremely difficult to protect itself from fundamental threats to its continued existence."</p>

As demonstrated in my thoughts on the topic, as part of the original post, American democracy doesn't seem to be able to sustain serious cleavages. More specifically, I think that point (2), is inaccurate. We clearly have not "disallowed all means." 
<ul>
<li>"some selectivity in regard to the fundamental values of those who are allowed to come, and to stay"
  
This [blog post](https://www.skepticink.com/tippling/2014/10/11/moral-panics-thoughts-on-immigration/) actually argues for a more robust moral framework with regards to the immigration process. Yet to some extent, it is already embedded in how we select and approve immigrants. A literal eligibility requirement to become a citizen is to be ["a person of good moral character"](https://www.usa.gov/become-us-citizen). We have [education requirements](https://www.usa.gov/green-cards#item-34817). As of the Supreme Court's decision few days ago, your [nationality matters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html).
<li>"constraints on certain kinds of critiques of leaders, authorities and institutions; constraints on free speech that exclude racist or intolerant speech"
  
Limits on hate speech exist, of course, but I actually disagree with the idea that constraints on free speech protects against the authoritarian dynamic, rather than the absence of constraints. Certainly, ideas dangerous to the system arise, but also decline; the popular saying of the free market of ideas apply here. This defense has clear weaknesses, especially in a time when absurd amounts of money can be utilized to drown out speakers and possible coordination has improved because of the internet. Yet natural constraints come in and out of existence as well. Definitely is an interesting topic though.
<li>"some ability to write moral strictures into public policy to reflect traditional beliefs where the majority “draws the line.”
  
Are moral strictures not inherently written into public policy by design? Not literally, but policy reflects moral sentiments. Civil rights cases, gay marriage cases (including the current Masterpiece baking shop case)...morality undergirds politics. Even in immoral legislation, and the reaction against it, basic moral beliefs are reflected. The line that Stenner speaks of is flexible. 
  </ul>
  
  
The American government is the method to limit and resolve social cleavages, and this power is frequently utilized, whether it be through the judicial, legislative, or executive branch. It's just that it is difficult for society to sustain these, and for politics to function, without some sense of resolution. Without developments in how Americans act toward a less fragmented moral culture, the government won't be able to continue through these divisions. Eventually, and already, it is acting: the tax plan, the administration's positions concerning immigration, finance, religious rights, foreign policy...it is settling the matter, much to the expense of the country's interests.
