title: Catalyst for Achievement
---

Let's again step into the ecosystem of Michigan nonprofits to look at [Catalyst for Achievement](https://www.catalystforachievement.org/), a Macomb county-based organization which mentors low-income, high-achieving students through the college application process to ensure the students reach colleges which match their potential. The [*undermatching problem*](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/education/scholarly-poor-often-overlook-better-colleges.html) - perhaps a niche issue - but one that local nonprofits are well-poised to remedy during the foreseeable future without further improvement of the high schools themselves. The issue has been well-documented, [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/education/scholarly-poor-often-overlook-better-colleges.html), [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2013a_hoxby.pdf), [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/03/16/393339590/why-many-smart-low-income-students-dont-apply-to-elite-schools), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/closing-the-income-gap-at-elite-colleges/2015/12/18/90f91054-a057-11e5-a3c5-c77f2cc5a43c_story.html), and the [Obama Administration](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/increasing_college_opportunity_for_low-income_students_report.pdf).

Catalyst for Achievement awards students with a scholarship to cover application fees to selective colleges, SAT retake costs, and study materials. Moreover, the organization provides a free mentoring service through committed volunteers for all awardees to streamline the application process, review essays, and find scholarships. Similar to how expensive prep classes, private tutors, or admissions reviewers are available to wealthy families, Catalyst for Achievement aims to level the disparity between rich and poor.

The organization isn't large, and very new. But the problem is real, and innovative attempts at solutions are desperately needed as low-income serving public high schools flounder amidst administrative, financial, and organizational issues. To outsource such necessary activities to nimble organizations that can adapt to individual needs is a good start to enabling students to succeed.

The model needn't be confined to a single high school. Catalyst for Achievement has plans for eventual expansion, I'm sure. Why can't the model be adapted to other communities as well? Volunteer-based organizations are vital for developing a competent citizenry. Volunteer opportunities, perhaps, need to be improved to fit the digital age.

Certainly, a few criticisms of this model could be mentioned. The [overall impact is limited currently](https://www.brookings.edu/research/can-we-fix-undermatching-in-higher-ed-would-it-matter-if-we-did/). It's difficult to expand quickly, yet through trial and error, I expect the organization to be highly successful in the future while the participants are involved. It's not enough to simply encourage students to apply to selective schools when they don't have the financial resources to attend, nor the support structure or ability to succeed. This issue is perhaps one that the organization can't solve. Yet it should be heeded, as students should be placed where they are [most likely to succeed, rather than to eliminate a numbers gap](http://edwp.educ.msu.edu/dean/2014/undermatching-is-overblown/). [Statistical issues with this econometric analysis exist](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bastedo/papers/BastedoFlaster.ER2014.pdf). Still, it seems that the [Brookings report](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2013a_hoxby.pdf) indicates an issue regardless: access to education is still not equal for all U.S. citizens. Moreover, the education that each student receives isn't always equal either, especially in a city like Detroit, where [report](http://www.blacdetroit.com/BLAC-Detroit/January-2016/Educational-Inequality/) after [report](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/28/michigan-school-funding-unequal/86477080/) after [report](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2016/08/22/detroit-grosse-pointe-schools-economic-divide/89131386/) demonstrates persistent inequality.

Enabling students to take advantage of educational opportunities is an integral part in encouraging citizens to develop themselves, an issue which I've discussed frequently. Whatever you think, take a few minutes to visit [Catalyst for Achievement's website](https://www.catalystforachievement.org/), and perhaps, donate your time or money!
