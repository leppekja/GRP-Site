title: Collaboration and a Tough Mudder
---
When the going gets tough, the tough collaborate.<!--excerpt-->

Pyramid Scheme is a 15', slanted, and slippery wall that you can't run up alone. Everest 2.0 is a nearly 17'quarter pipe, specifically designed to prevent grabbing on to the ledge to pull yourself up. And Loch Ness Monster is a 5' deep pool of water dyed green, with huge rotating rectangular blocks that teams must push up to help others go over.

These are team obstacles. These obstacles are designed not for the solo runners aiming to obtain the fastest time, but for the larger community, for the groups that come together and leave hand-in-hand. After my third Tough Mudder this year, these were the memorable obstacles. It was the collaborative obstacles, the ones that rewarded cooperation, that make the Tough Mudder so enjoyable.

Doing races like these remind you about the nature of incentives in terms of collaboration, and how these principles are necessary to achieve success. Collaboration requires perceived benefits to outweigh costs for all parties involved, as well as a method to facilitate interaction, and usually, an obstacle that you cannot overcome alone. It's difficult to convince a person to spend their time on a project on which they receive none of the returns. Personally, on obstacles that I could overcome without help, I enjoyed completing by myself. Others, it seemed, felt the same; collaboration was of little use on problems we could solve ourselves. These obstacles were the most disappointing, overcome quickly and without much satisfaction. We did not celebrate overcoming the obstacles by ourselves, but instead shared the specific thoughts and issues we each faced (perhaps our limited reach, or slow speed) and the solutions we found (leveraging our speed, or our strength).

My conclusion is not that collaboration allows us to solve problems we can't solve ourselves, but that the problems that necessitate collaboration are the most worthwhile to pursue. Solutions created by one person are devised for that person; community solutions, however, are inclusive and openly-sourced. However, I don't regard this as minimizing the individual, as its method of solving is by capitalizing on the local knowledge of each collaborator. The most general questions seem to be the most difficult to solve, as they require the sum experience of individuals, rather than one entity supplying a general solution.

As in the Tough Mudder, collaboration between the tall and the short, the weak and the strong, the quick and the slow allows each runner to solve the same problem. We shouldn't change the constraints of the obstacle relative to the individual, but should collaborate to bypass the constraints of the individual.
