title: Changing the Conversation: Climate change
---

Minutes ago, [a comprehensive report on climate change funded by 13 U.S. federal agencies was released](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/). <!--excerpt--> Its conclusions are in [direct contradiction](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/climate/us-climate-report.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) to the stated policies and intentions of the Trump administration.

This will likely dominate the news cycle for the near future - yet its ramifications are far from certain. Op-eds throughout next week will almost certainly focus on the remaining holdouts; how, they will question, can anybody still hold a position of outright denial? This segment of the population will be decried immediately, furthering a social cleavage over an increasingly existential threat. It is no longer a question of science as is or is not, but of how much, and during this conversion it morphed into a question of politics, of communication, and of identity.

This passage from the NYT article on the topic is telling:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
Critics of climate change science attacked the report as the product of holdovers from former President Obama’s administration, and also chastised the Trump administration for allowing it to be published. Others said the science may be valid but those findings should not affect laws to address the rise of emissions.

“I really don’t think that determines policy at all,” said Marlo Lewis Jr., a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Mr. Lewis said he does not deny that the majority of warming is caused by man-made emissions. But, he said, “The thing is, I’m also going to affirm that there are risks of climate policy as well as climate change. To me the real issue is, where do the risks lie? Suppressing your economy is never a good solution.” </p>

The controversy, I think, of climate changes largely lies not in the problem, but in its proposed solutions. It has been a running communications and policy failure of the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, and news outlets, to distinguish the two, and this has led to the current situation we find ourselves in. Many establishment conservatives and prominent libertarians frequently identify the problem as quoted above, but why no one seems to be listening is beyond my knowledge. I suppose it's much easier to pick up a widely-confirmed report and point at it than it is to have a serious discussion about environmental regulation.

The parties, once again, whether deliberately or by mistake, encourage debate over just the tip of the (currently melting) iceberg. Is or is not questions produce sound-bites and deflect the attention to the other side - which seems to be the policy of the Democratic Party on every question since November 2016. The Obama Administration, [despite what seems to be a fairly decent record in terms of intention](http://nationswell.com/15-experts-obamas-environmental-legacy/) but [transactional at best](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2015/4/2/1375169/-Obama-s-Complicated-and-Contradictory-Environmental-Record-in-Two-Press-Releases) and hampered by political failures [(especially the Paris Accords)](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/obama-climate-change-paris-agreement-italy/index.html). And mass media outlets, primarily political commentary, feed on these simplified and sensationalized debates, choosing profit over any sense of 'accountability to the public' - and [this outcome should be expected, not surprising](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZO.html) (Sec III, 3(b)1).

Looking ahead, the conversation must change from who is right and wrong to what the benefits of a sustainable, environmentally-friendly approach are. How can government regulation incentivize industries to invest in American jobs? How does green technology  increase American stature internationally? How can a switch to sustainable energy sources from fossil fuels create new opportunities for American workers? By focusing on economic policy that is also environmentally-friendly, it is possible to reframe the conversation to a discussion not contingent on identity or political affiliation, but around a brighter future for all Americans. Trump won because he spoke in terms of money, power, and jobs. While this isn't a long term solution, it's necessary for the Democrats to recognize this and use it to combat climate change.

This will doubtfully happen. The Democratic Party seems to be content with acting as the opposition party in totality. Republicans have no incentive to reach out for compromise. Perhaps President Trump will surprise us all, but his picks for the [EPA](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-picks-top-climate-skeptic-to-lead-epa-transition/) and [NASA](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/01/marco-rubio-bill-nelson-trump-nasa-jim-bridenstine-242269) don't offer hope.
