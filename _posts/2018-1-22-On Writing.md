[No Longer Writing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/books/review/philip-roth-interview.html), Philip Roth Still Has Plenty to Say <!--excerpt-->

Simply this:

> C.M. Looking back, how do you recall your 50-plus years as a writer?

> P.R. Exhilaration and groaning. Frustration and freedom. Inspiration and uncertainty. Abundance and emptiness. Blazing forth and muddling through. The day-by-day repertoire of oscillating dualities that any talent withstands â€” and tremendous solitude, too. And the silence: 50 years in a room silent as the bottom of a pool, eking out, when all went well, my minimum daily allowance of usable prose.

Highly recommend reading the whole interview. It's succinct.
