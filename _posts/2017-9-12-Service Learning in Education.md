title: Service-Learning in Education
---
In Fall 2016, Michigan State University launched the Community Engaged Scholar Program with 12 students. Partnering with Midtown Detroit, Inc., the program was designed to integrate service into a learning curriculum, and allowed for students to gain a practical understanding of application and implementation. Traveling to Detroit each week ensured an out-of-the-classroom experience. From working in-office with economic development specialists to exploring the city through service projects, the program encouraged interaction with a diverse group of specialists, businessmen and women, residents, and academics to clarify all aspects of development - the positives and negatives.

The National Youth Leadership Council puts it simply:

"Picking up trash on a river bank is service.

Studying water samples under a microscope is learning.

When science students collect and analyze water samples, document their results, and present findings to a local pollution control agency â€“ that is service-learning."

Service-Learning projects, integrated into curriculum, offer numerous benefits to participants - and society. Programs have been thoroughly demonstrated to correlate with higher academic achievement and high school graduation rates, caused increased interest in and better retaining of course materials, and increased volunteerism among participants (Kielsmeier 2004; Scales 2006; Celio 2011). It's easy to see how this happens.

Why aren't these programs instituted more frequently in programs of learning? Funding dried up concerning research 7 or 8 years ago. Programming is difficult to manage, and requires high levels of coordination. It can be difficult to integrate learning opportunities into curriculum.

Yet resources exist across the Internet to design and implement such programs. Hopefully, with rising issues in education that limit the effectiveness of a typical education, growth in active learning programs will encourage service-learning opportunities across the nation.
