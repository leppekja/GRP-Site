Philosophy through Art: Edvard Munch's *Despair (1892)*, *The Scream (1893)*, and *Anxiety (1894)* <!--excerpt-->

To look out to the natural world is overwhelming. Every moment we spend looking up at a mountain or peering down from its peak; every second spent gazing across the lake and into the thick forest or rolling plains that lie beyond: we almost lose some sense of self. The feeling of witnessing beauty, a sense that evades capture, unconquerable by our hands and tools, repudiates any sense of control we have. In music, art, sport, or political movement, individual identities are subsumed by a force much greater; its immensity bearing down on us, poor things of bones and blood with little understanding of the world around us. We become more aware of our fragility, perhaps, knowing that a piece of music, a landscape, or a revolution will long outlive us. 

In the awareness of our defeat, we despair:

Notice the brushstrokes pulling Munch into the corner of the landscape, blurring his entire being into the background that dominates the artwork, his once-unique facial features totally absent. The landscape, with its bright streaks of red in the sky and notable ships in the distance, the careful coloring of the cliff, is given more attention then the subject of the painting himself. He is not at the center of his own experience; rather, it is the cause of his despair: the unyielding, immense world around him. The wooden railing, with its three straight bars, is the only thing that holds him, and the only fully defined feature.

Munch, portrayed alone here, his friends walk off ahead distracted by one another. This amplifies the sense of solitude, further contrasting the landscape that practically envelopes Munch. This despair, while instantly recognizable to the individual that contemplates the piece, isn't shared with others. Among company, the hallowness is momentarily fulfilled; even the awareness of it isn't frequently commented on. How can we express it? A feeling of yearning, in some sense, to be swallowed up by time, always surrendering.

His despair quickly gives way to pain as his humanity is literally destroyed:

The landscape dissolves into a recognizable flow of energy, with color solely differentiating between our usual understanding of the material and immaterial. The land, the sky, the water, the rock; all are further abstracted to swirling lines. Their momentum overtakes the city in blackness and reduces the ships to thin black lines against the bright light reflecting off the water. The staid railing now stands in further contrast to the wavy landscape, the only safety from falling; the light harshly reflecting off and the bright oranges and reds are assaulting its frame near the bottom-right corner.

Munch, as portrayed in the painting, is now a figure, not recognizable as the smartly-dressed man in *Despair*, his top-hat gone and attire reduced to flowing black lines, reminiscent of the popular rendering of Grim Reaper's robes. He is no longer human, fading into the background, or more accurately, being forcefully absorbed into the rest of nature. As [one analysis notes](https://www.edvardmunch.org/the-scream.jsp) (rightly, I think), "the scream could be interpreted as expressing the agony of the obliteration of human personality by this unifying force." It continues, "the creature in the foreground has been depersonalized and crushed into sexlessness or, if anything, stamped with a trace of the femininity of the world that has come close to assimilating it." The men, even further off in the distance now, remain as a reminder of the dominion of mens, seemingly unaware of Munch's transformation.

And finally, the collective anxiety of those who remain. Their features already distorted slightly, their clothing binds them to their humanity. It's depicted as the subjects are aware of their eventual fate. Even if the world around them has calmed down, biding its time, they understand the precarious position they are in.
