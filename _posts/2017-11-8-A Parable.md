Imagine waking up to find yourself in a precarious situation. <!--excerpt-->Hanging from the ceiling, cuffed at the wrists, with open water below your feet, extending in all directions to the edges of your vision. You are trapped; the waves splash up against each other, undulating, just beneath your swinging feet.

Our natural reaction is to struggle against the cuffs, pulling ourselves up, hoping to free ourselves; quickly though, we see that this is hopeless. At this point, then, you may choose how to respond. There is, of course, no purpose in your struggle, no chance of escape, no reward for freedom, and as such, you may conclude that just to hang there is preferable.

Yet as you wait patiently, you start hallucinating. At moments, you see outcroppings of rock just beyond your reach. On them, your desires: family, government, entertainment, each offering relief in their own way. Gaining momentum, you swing your body violently against the cuffs; the tips of your toes grasp each stone for a second before slipping. You spend the next ten years in this fashion, spending days in pain for seconds of pleasure.

The distinction between non-attachment and detachment, in the English language, isn't so clear for many at first sight. The translation to detachment, it's clear, has too many incorrect implications, especially combined with the stereotypes already in place of Buddhist thought.

Imagine you are a child again, at the playground, standing in front of the monkey bars. With both hands, you grab the first bar, and for awhile, you hang there. Here, you are attached, paralyzed, too nervous to go forward, too high up to fall without getting hurt. This position will get you no closer to the end.

Your apparent alternative option is to detach, to simply fall the few feet into the woodchips. You don't reach the end, of course. You aren't even participating any longer.

The third option is nonattachment. Swinging your body, gaining momentum, you swing from one bar to the next, one hand following the other. With that momentum, hanging on by one hand, you continue swinging, not slowing down or looking back, not clutching a bar in fear of falling, not letting go. Soon, you reach the end.

A person who is heavily dependent on relationships may very well have stable relationships that rectify that individual’s weaknesses for the entirety of their lives. This person would never have to confront their failings and live a decent life, except for short periods of time when someone they depend on is traveling, upset etc.. They would simply correct the relationship or find someone else to lean on.

Most of us, I think, live this way; it’s as if we’re swimming in the ocean from lighthouse to lighthouse, afraid of drowning because we’re weak swimmers, yet unwilling to trust the ocean enough to learn to swim well. It’s exhausting, and it isn’t surprising that as we grow older, we grow more comfortable being alone, knowing that the next lighthouse isn’t as bright as it appears from our vantage point in the water. To achieve relationships that move past superficiality, I think, requires a person who is incredibly secure with their being, or in other words, emotionally safe. It requires a good swimmer, one who trusts him- or herself.
