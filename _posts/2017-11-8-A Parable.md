Imagine waking up to find yourself in a precarious situation. <!--excerpt-->Hanging from the ceiling, cuffed at the wrists, with open water below your feet, extending in all directions to the edges of your vision. You are trapped; the waves splash up against each other, undulating, just beneath your swinging feet.

Our natural reaction is to struggle against the cuffs, pulling ourselves up, hoping to free ourselves; quickly though, we see that this is hopeless. At this point, then, you may choose how to respond. There is, of course, no purpose in your struggle, no chance of escape, no reward for freedom, and as such, you may conclude that just to hang there is preferable.

Yet as you wait patiently, you start hallucinating. At moments, you see outcroppings of rock just beyond your reach. On them, your desires: family, government, entertainment, each offering relief in their own way. Gaining momentum, you swing your body violently against the cuffs; the tips of your toes grasp each stone for a second before slipping. You spend the next ten years in this fashion, spending days in pain for seconds of pleasure.

The distinction between non-attachment and detachment, in the English language, isn't so clear for many at first sight. The translation to detachment, it's clear, has too many incorrect implications, especially combined with the stereotypes already in place of Buddhist thought.

Imagine you are a child again, at the playground, standing in front of the monkey bars. With both hands, you grab the first bar, and for awhile, you hang there. Here, you are attached, paralyzed, too nervous to go forward, too high up to fall without getting hurt. This position will get you no closer to the end.

Your apparent alternative option is to detach, to simply fall the few feet into the woodchips. You don't reach the end, of course. You aren't even participating any longer.

The third option is nonattachment. Swinging your body, gaining momentum, you swing from one bar to the next, one hand following the other. With that momentum, hanging on by one hand, you continue swinging, not slowing down or looking back, not clutching a bar in fear of falling, not letting go. Soon, you reach the end.
