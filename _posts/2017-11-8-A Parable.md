Imagine waking up to find yourself in a precarious situation. Hanging from the ceiling, cuffed at the wrists, with open water below your feet, extending in all directions to the edges of your vision. You are trapped; the waves splash up against each other, undulating, just beneath your swinging feet.

Our natural reaction is to struggle against the cuffs, pulling ourselves up, hoping to free ourselves; quickly though, we see that this is hopeless. At this point, then, you may choose how to respond. There is, of course, no purpose in your struggle, no chance of escape, no reward for freedom, and as such, you may conclude that just to hang there is preferable.

The third option is nonattachment. Swinging your body, gaining momentum, you swing from one bar to the next, one hand following the other. With that momentum, hanging on by one hand, you continue swinging, not slowing down or looking back, not clutching a bar in fear of falling, not letting go. Soon, you reach the end.
