title: Economies in Context

"a political environment that permits or even enables...a massive accumulation of economic power." - [Matt Stoller](https://newrepublic.com/article/143595/return-monopoly-amazon-rise-business-tycoon-white-house-democrats-return-party-trust-busting-roots) <!--excerpt-->

Economics, in its attempt to redefine itself as a hard science, frequently divorces itself from complications. Assumptions underlie economic calculations, and these assumptions are more important then [the math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_envy) - see, for example, [estimates for growth](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/opinion/mnuchin-paul-ryan-taxes.html) regarding the Republican tax plan, or [unemployment rate measures](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/true-unemployment-rate-u6-vs-u3.asp). Especially in economics, the study of scarcity, of how goods are distributed, basic assumptions are radically symplifying, and don't reflect reality well. For example, humans are considered [rational, self-interested actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus) that act choose optimal outcomes, yet this has been throughly debunked. A recent *Free Thoughts* podcast entitled [How the Powerful Captured the Economy](https://www.libertarianism.org/media/free-thoughts/how-powerful-captured-economy) captures exactly these links that none of us understand in full.

We don't, it seems, have a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between political, economic, and social spheres, despite [the long history](https://economicsbd.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/a-brief-history-of-economics-2/) of public intellectuals promoting exactly this. The recent divergence from political economy to solely economics, while resulting in brilliant achievements in the field, has also left the public behind. 

Now, this complaint could be made of any specialization. Without formal training, in any field, it's easy to conflate phenomena and misunderstand advancements. Yet in fields of study as pertinent to our lives as politics and economics, it's easy to form viewpoints. We think we're experts on our own lives, and unfortunately, this false expertise lends itself to suggestions on others' lives. The least competent are [the most confident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

We're operating [out of context](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/opinion/economy-bubble-recession.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region), not seeing the whole picture; oftentimes, not even looking out over the massive edge we're perched on. But why would we? It's more comfortable to look at our own feet.
