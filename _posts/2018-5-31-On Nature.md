title: On Nature; A Discussion
---
Thursday, 5/31/18, 6:30PM<!--excerpt-->

We spoke, last night, on nature. The following is a brief recapitulation of what we discussed. Hopefully I've accurately restated various arguments and provided them with their best justifications; if not, feel free to reach out at grplansing@gmail.com to request an adjustment. Interjections of comments are marked within em dashes.

The intent of these written follow-ups is to connect a few key statements from our conversations to previous philosophical work directly. For those interested, it will help place current thought within the history of philosophy and connect you with further resources that will clarify/refute thoughts. Let me know if it is helpful/not, or if the format should be adjusted. Sorry that this summary is more stream-of-consciousness style than those previous.

We're part of nature, despite our frequent characterizations as it being separate. How we understand nature is reflective of how we see ourselves. Major differences arise as opposing views on this topic of being in harmony with nature to being masters of it. Should we distinguish nature as the physical world, or is a discussion on metaphysical aspects required here? Nature, somehow, seems more spiritual than indoors. Is this the result of 10,000 years of life, harbored in our biology, comfortable outdoors, and stressed in artificial environments, or something more?

What is the state of nature? Usually framed either as harmony or conflict, but difficult to accept that dichotomy as accurate. What is this balance of nature that we casually refer to? Animals are at the mercy of nature, perhaps, and humans are overcompensating for that long-occurring weakness, seeking dominion over the environment? Are our conceptions of nature flexible?

What does it mean to live within the natural order of things? How do we reconnect with nature? For instance, cities and forests can both be described as emergent natural phenomena, yet human constructed objects are considered artificial? How do we define what is and isn't artificial? Best guess was purposely synthesized materials through the use of tool, which could use some refinement.

How does scarcity figure into this conversation? Distribution of natural resources? Challenging versus coexisting with nature. Nature, surely, imposes limits on what is possible. Are impressive human feats challenging nature or ourselves, or is this another false dichotomy? How are humans different than animals?

How does the human body adapt to changing circumstances? Can a natural environment of a creature change? How would this occur, and is it to be desired or resisted?

How does culture emerge as a natural phenomenon, or language? What relation exists between this and other examples of emergent order, and how do they fit in with competing conceptions of nature? How have we learned from our environments?
