title: An Uncertain Life
---
Attention freely given is time poorly spent.
<!--excerpt-->
For the last few weeks, we've been sharing our thoughts on systems that provide various levels of certainty into our experiences. Whether it be science, reason, or truth, these processes allow us to gain some measure of understanding in the world and determine our own place within it. Last night, we asked why it is this way.

The following is a brief recapitulation of what we discussed. Hopefully I've accurately restated various arguments and provided them with their best justifications; if not, feel free to reach out at grplansing@gmail.com to request an adjustment. Interjections are marked within em dashes. I've tried to limit my thoughts, in italics, to brief points and entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that may provide clarification.

The intent of these written follow-ups is to connect a few key statements from our conversations to previous philosophical work directly. For those interested, it will help place current thought within the history of philosophy, and connect you with further resources that will clarify/refute thoughts. Let me know if it is helpful/not, or if the format should be adjusted.

**w/r/t certainty**

How do we respond when presented with two conflicting certainties? Science and religion, for example. On some level, it feels as if an integral part of my being has been attacked when science demonstrates inaccuracies in my belief system.

*This is an [enduring](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/opinion/sunday/science-and-religion.html) question. No answers here, but in my view, untested beliefs are worth little. Certainty is [not knowledge](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/26/karl-popper-in-search-of-a-better-world-truth-certainty/).*

To Thine own self be true.

*As a skeptic of this advice, [this article](http://bigthink.com/the-proverbial-skeptic/to-thine-own-self-be-true-really) roughly echoed what I mentioned at the meeting. Or read [Hamlet](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/full.html). A better interpretation, though, is [here](http://www.evolutionarypathways.com/thine-own-self-be-true.html). If you're interested in authenticity, here's a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxrmOHJQRSs) and a [somewhat lengthy article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/). Perhaps we only know our [own minds](http://www.iep.utm.edu/solipsis/), however.*

For young people in previous generations, owning a home was the natural path, a statement of certainty.

*Really interesting point. How do the sources of certainty change over time? For instance, religious beliefs, scientific reasoning, nationalism, professions - it seems to me that in the past, a secure identity arose through our affiliations. In the past 100 years or so, as concepts of individualism became more popular, a greater emphasis was placed on indentity through personal experience and actions. Admittedly, this is often subsumed by group identities, but it still seems as if there is a general trend toward self-actualization. Additionally, with the rise in living standards, especially in the U.S., a majority of younger people now obtain certainty through personal relations with others. For example, living through the 2008 recession had a [negative impact](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shreyaagarwal/2016/05/06/homeownership-rates-are-falling-and-its-not-just-a-millennial-problem/#5d85d6e2494a) on rates of home ownership. It's not clear, however, if this is because of changing generational interests or simply [external constraints](https://www.point2homes.com/news/canada-real-estate/home-ownership-rates-drop-millennials-opt-rent.html) like money/location/ease of ownership.*

Interactions through language are aimed to [reduce uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_reduction_theory).

[Process philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/) points that change is the constant state of being.

*Similar to the Buddhist's recognition of [impermanence](https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/impermanence/).*
