"Mr. Trump should not underestimate the steep human cost of initiating a war against Pyongyang." <!--excerpt-->

In the opening pages of [Vietnam: A History](http://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/books/the-vietnam-war-recounted-and-relived.html) by Stanley Karnow, we read that the "central theme of the book is that America's leaders, prompted as much by domestic politics as by global ambitions, carried the United States into Southeast Asia with little regard for the realities of the region." Replace, perhaps, Southeast Asia with Korea, or Afghanistan, or Iraq...

It is quite possible that we will make the same error once again. Policy toward North Korea has been erratic, seemingly unplanned, yet steadily more hostile. Further indicating a preference for military action is that Trump has a cabinet full of military advisors, is decreasing foriegn aid across the world due to its perceived ineffectiveness, and sees little to no value in diplomacy. A war, for Trump, could even be seen as attractive: it generates headlines. I can't speak to the information he receives, but does he truly believe that this war could be over quickly? 

There is certainly the possibility that our armed forces are more effective than I understand, but [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/opinion/north-korea-united-states-war.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region), quoted in the excerpt, is persuasive. Even in the best of circumstances, [surrounding countries](https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1204499/kcn-eh-novembers-other-north-korean-developments/) is seriously threatened. Numerous analyses arrive at this conclusion, including [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/2017/05/05/what-war-north-korea-looks-588861.html) and [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/an-expert-warns-that-a-preemptive-strike-on-north-korea-would-lead-to-very-big-war/). Moreover, I expect that North Korean forces will have a similar mentality to the North Vietnamese army. The [recent PBS documentary](http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/home/) noted this; one interviewee said that 1 American body for every 10 North Vietnamese troops killed was a favorable ratio. Nicholas Kristof visited North Korea, and [his op-eds](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/opinion/north-korea-missiles-war.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2FNicholas%20Kristof&action=click&contentCollection=Opinion&module=Collection&region=Marginalia&src=me&version=column&pgtype=article), with the [corresponding video interactive](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/28/opinion/columnists/missile-test-north-korea.html?action=click&contentCollection=Opinion&module=RelatedCoverage&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article), strengthen this perception of a country ready for war. Defections aren't tolerated well, even if it's pretty clear that the interviewees in the video clearly are being monitored concerning their responses. I don't trust that an invasion would be completed quickly without abhorrent loss of life. 

The Brookings method (article referenced above) of deterrence seems to be the most sensible, and I hope that Trump and his administration's blustering is merely a tactic to reinforce our willingness to respond in the event of N.K. nuclear strikes. Otherwise, history may repeat itself. With time, it won't be hard to look back on these small steps as clear indicators of escalation, and as warning signs. A few years ago, Christopher Clark wrote a book, [*The Sleepwalkers*](https://www.amazon.com/Sleepwalkers-How-Europe-Went-1914/dp/0061146668), about the lead up to World War 2. With an excellent portrayal of the power relationships and conflicting political interests across countries and their leaders, it stands to question: have we learned anything about the intangible forces and weaknesses in human nature that lead to conflict? 

I worry that we place too much emphasis on action in matters of international conflict. When punched, we punch back. When a fire starts, we douse it. When threatened, we run. But those reactions, those instincts, are natural. Yet some points in our lives, we must restrain ourselves; to not retaliate, to let the [wildfire run its course](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/06/science/let-forest-fires-burn-what-the-black-backed-woodpecker-knows.html), and to [calmly respond](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/the-madness-behind-trumps-madman-strategy.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FCuban%20Missile%20Crisis%20(1962)&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=collection) against intimidation. These are much more difficult decisions, and whether President Trump is fit to make them isn't clear.
