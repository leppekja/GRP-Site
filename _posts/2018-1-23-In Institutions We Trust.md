title: In Institutions We (Don't) Trust (1 of 2)
---
The 2018 Edelman TRUST BAROMETER reveals a world of seemingly stagnant distrust. <!--excerpt-->

A [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/23/edelman-surveyed-americans-about-trust-the-findings-are-disturbing/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-posteverything%3Ahomepage%2Fcard) today reminded me a few thoughts I had written down a few months ago without publishing, so I wanted to follow up today to ask: 

*What are resilient institutions, and if possible, how are they created and sustained?*

**Part I**

We'll start, briefly, with a review of the role of institutions in society. Institutions allow society to function more efficiently. Either [informally or formally defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution), these mechanisms provide methods to facilitate every aspect of being within a group, from casual social greetings to the distribution of public services. In many cases, these "soft" institutions are so subtle that we aren't cognizant of how our behavior is manipulated, justifying choices through "well, it's just the way it's done." In contrast, "hard" institutions utilize explicit reasoning. Regardless, I imagine institutions as layers formed over raw substances, or the rules that govern behavior, providing some sense of security during interactions between objects. 

What makes institutions valuable? On a societal scale, successful institutions are those which are agreed upon by involved parties, either implicitly or explicitly. W/r/t implicit agreements, being a white male American, traditionally, is an example of an implicit recognition of a certain value system; more widely, states sign [social contracts](http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/) with their citizens. The primary value measurement here is how often an institution is disrupted. Concerning individuals, however, value measurements are more ends-focused i.e. the specific perceived benefit they receive from acquiescing to the institution's expectations. Communities, or in other small-to-medium group settings, allow for a more equal weighing of compliance and reward while determining successful institutions. 

A cohesive definition of a successful institution is then a widely adopted pattern of behavior that facilitates optimal results between interactions of individuals.

It seems that a trade-off between compliance and benefit is necessary in every practical circumstance. Once groups grow large enough, individuals' initial aims will diverge into incompatible interests, thus fostering disagreement. Hence, the formal institutions of government emerge and accompany informal methods of interaction, designed specifically to mitigate losses from this compliance/value tension. 

Yet over time, the balance between compliance/value will shift for individuals, and necessitate institutional change. Compliance seems to be a function of how individuals perceive the benefits of the institution. This is what the next few sections will focus on: how do we perceive the value of institutions?

**Part II**

It's common to note the decline of trust in institutions (see above, [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/how-americans-lost-trust-in-our-greatest-institutions/256163/), [here](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/ads-public-opinion/trust-others-institutions-declining-america-data-underlying-cultural-shifts), [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/03/americans-have-lost-faith-in-institutions-thats-not-because-of-trump-or-fake-news/), [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/02/12/the-decline-of-trust-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/#3ae9d7002873), [here](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/americas_trust_fall), and [I've done it](www.grassrootsphilosophy.org/_posts/2017-11-30-Adapting-to-Decay.md/)). Drawing on the above conclusion, the lack of trust in institutions refers to the declining perception that current institutions will not result in optimal social and individual outcomes. 

This allows for [Drezner's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/23/edelman-surveyed-americans-about-trust-the-findings-are-disturbing/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-posteverything%3Ahomepage%2Fcard) conclusion that political polarization is driving decreased trust in government to stand. He concludes:
>What’s driving the drop in the Edelman survey is not a further erosion of trust in government so much as increased political polarization leading to different definitions of “government".

[Edelman's data](https://www.edelman.com/trust-barometer) only goes back to 2016. Drezner himself, [in a 2016 op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/19/could-the-erosion-of-trust-in-government-be-at-an-end/?utm_term=.4a3e4b8f12fd&tid=a_mcntx), quotes the data that [general confidence in institutions](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx) demonstrates a gradual decline in the past 20-40 years (some questions were asked since the 1970s, some since the 1990s). Drezner rightly points out that the survey is limited by its broad definitions. So arguably, we can attribute the changing levels of trust in "government" to how political polarization affects individual's perception.

Yet is this sustainable? [Bill Bishop for the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/03/americans-have-lost-faith-in-institutions-thats-not-because-of-trump-or-fake-news/) argues that:
>You have to assume that institutions will be fair and that leaders will act in the country’s best interest.

He continues:
>Political scientist Ron Inglehart proposed in the 1970s that as societies grow wealthier and less concerned about basic survival, we should expect a shift from communal to individual values: People express themselves more and trust authorities less.

Bishop and Inglehart place the onus of the blame on the structure of [modern society](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/ads-public-opinion/trust-others-institutions-declining-america-data-underlying-cultural-shifts). And I [absolutely agree](http://grassrootsphilosophy.org/Identity-Within-Declining-Community/) with them. We're increasingly asking the question: does this impersonal tradition, practice, or organization produce socially and/or (much more likely) personally optimal results if I participate? Optimal, here, being regarded as a cost/benefit analysis. A multitude of factors - including political polarization - goes into a person's choice to participate, and it's not easy to parse relevant variables as to why they make a certain decision. So, fluctuations in trust levels of institutions is perfectly natural, especially in response to events. 

Yet let's pause for a brief digression here to explore the link between freedom, the self, and authority.

**Part III**

> Bauman points out that Freud's thesis that human beings had traded freedom for security has been inverted; now we have traded security for freedom and with that freedom has come unprecedented responsibilities for the conduct of our own emotional lives and for our political participation. - [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/05/society)

This part, admittedly, sets the stage for an upcoming post, which I'll link to in the future. It's based on the trite observation that there is something unsettling to all of this choice, and that many Americans seek meaningful and purposeful lives. As we live our lives, we eventually locate acceptable balance of certainty and uncertainty. It may be conscious or not. As trust in institutions declines, that is, as the self becomes the primary locus of action and reliance, we upend this traditional balance, producing anxiety. This is disconcerting, and many of us long for less uncertainty in our lives, which is manifested in psychological perceptions of personal responsibility, security. We long for rules, like those that Jordan Peterson lays out [in an upcoming book](https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/), fittingly subtitled *An Antidote to Chaos*. It isn't surprising that his videos are popular with young uneducated white men, under fire from popular culture, portrayed as adrift, their values attacked, and common institutions failing. It allows for a solidification of who they are - it simplifies things. And I suspect all of us are tempted by simplification of this manner, as seen also in modern American progressivism and in general attachment to a "pure" ideology.

Institutions are external mechanisms that reinforce personal identities. These informal and formal structures allow us to estimate our place in society, to determine what we should do in our lives, to accept certain values and beliefs without sustained questioning, to outsource difficult self-examination to others. 

There's much more to this I'll discuss, but for this post, it's sufficient to note that institutions are valuable structures to the individuals participating in and reacting to them as it pertains to identity. What this implies is that as conceptions of identity change, institutions will invariably adjust with them. Notably, our "trust in each other has declined much more steadily and consistently than has our trust in institutions" ([Paxton & Smith 2008](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/americas_trust_fall)).

With this in mind, the actual question I'm interested in for this post is: how do we determine the extent to which the institutions change in response to adjusting conceptions of identity, and how do we determine the robustness of institutions?

**Conclusion**
>Still, no metrics exist to measure life without institutions, because they've been around as long as humankind. The first institution was the first family. The tribe was the first community. The first tribe's leader was the first politician, and its elders were the first legislature. Its guards, the first police force. Its storyteller, a teacher. Humans are coded to create communities, and communities beget institutions.

>What if, in the future, they don't? People could disconnect, refocus inward, and turn away from their social contract. Already, many are losing trust. If society can't promise benefits for joining it, its members may no longer feel bound to follow its rules. But is the rise of disillusionment inexorable? Can institutions regain their mojo? ([Fournier & Quinton 2012](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/how-americans-lost-trust-in-our-greatest-institutions/256163/))

I've argued previously that institutions need to adapt to changing times to survive, in one form or another. Of course, this isn't technically resiliency, then, depending on the extent of the institutional adjustment. Adaptability is necessary for institutions. Yet for this essay, I'm speaking rather broadly, and I'll keep using resiliency for a few reasons:
- Adaptation, in my mind, occurs over a longer time frame (>100 years) than resiliency, which I'd use regarding shorter time frames and institutional responses to extreme events.
- Institutions, generally, have well-defined functions and shapes. It's changes in values that affect institutions, and as such, we want institutions that last through these changes in topical values. Obviously, some social institutions are repugnant and should be done away with as quick as possible.
- All institutions are adaptable, by nature of human evolution. Like above, the question is how to create institutions that work for large groups of people with varying value systems that absorb shocks and maintain compliance and benefits. 

So yes, we want adaptable but not too adaptable institutions. As we continue into a increasingly individualized world, where personal freedoms are ever expanded, and contracted by social forces, I think (barring any sort of worldwide egalitarian shift in consciousness) that humankind needs firm institutions that limit the effects of populist perceptions, like many set up in our Constitution. Of course, all institutions will eventually need to change to reflect a (hopefully) more egalitarian world with technological progress and economic growth.

Many current proposed solutions aren't the [adapting of institutions](http://grassrootsphilosophy.org/Adapting-to-Decay/), but [coping of the individuals](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/how-americans-lost-trust-in-our-greatest-institutions/256163/). We see the problem, but we don't know how to fix it. We're instead filled with anxiety, distracting ourselves with the hedonistic treadmill of consumption and vicious cycle of comparison.

Perhaps we don't fully appreciate the impact that institutions have on shaping our lives. As I previously wrote, we're increasingly asking the question: does this impersonal tradition, practice, or organization produce socially and/or (much more likely) personally optimal results if I participate? Unfortunately, we're simply falling into different socialized responses, coping mechanisms, to deal with this perceived lack of institutions.

The second question that we need to be asking is: if not, how can I improve it so I and others will?

With this groundwork, the next post will finally answer the question we're interested in: 
*What are resilient institutions, and if possible, how are they created and sustained?*
