"This Notice of [Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/05/2017-25802/tip-regulations-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act-flsa) seeks the views of the public on the Department's proposed rescission of those portions of the regulations." <!--excerpt-->

The Department of Labor [recently introduced](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20171204) a proposal to reverse 2011 regulations that affect tip pooling which "applies [in cases] where employers pay a full minimum wage and do not take a tip credit and allows sharing tips through a tip pool with employees who do not traditionally receive direct tips â€“ such as restaurant cooks and dish washers." Amid conflicting court decisions and unclear state and federal legislation, the public now has its chance to comment on the proposed change.

Public involvement in agency regulations is important. Yet thousands of these regulations are posted each year - and they often are not easy reads. Strong comments address pros and cons, alternatives, adequate reasoning, and credentials. Sure, there is a minimum baseline - but with many of these regulations, that minimum can be difficult to reach for many people. Still, public comments offer valuable local knowledge, specifically in [medical/health](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm143569.htm) or [environmental](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233641693_The_Public_Comment_Process_What_Do_Citizens_Contribute_to_National_Forest_Management) contexts. Demonstrating that a large segment of the population does oppose a certain rule change can affect public perception of an issue, as seen in the net neutrality decisions. Yet, as seen in the same decision, comments don't always work.

The comments, unfortunately, aren't always valuable. Since the 5th of December, over [75,000 public comments](https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=50&so=DESC&sb=postedDate&po=0&dct=PS&D=WHD-2017-0003) have been received on [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/) on the tip pooling regulations. Take a moment and look through the comments; largely, they are clearly copied/pasted from some organizing movement. This number is dwarfed by millions of comments submitted regarding the [net neutrality debate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/24/fcc-net-neutrality-process-corrupted-by-fake-comments-and-vanishing-consumer-complaints-officials-say/), which suffered from [fake email addresses, names, and hacking attempts](https://www.pewinternet.org/2017/11/29/public-comments-to-the-federal-communications-commission-about-net-neutrality-contain-many-inaccuracies-and-duplicates/). It is [quantity, not quality](https://medium.com/@AGSchneiderman/an-open-letter-to-the-fcc-b867a763850a). While expressing solidarity is key to demonstrating that a majority of constituents are opposed to a proposed regulation, it doesn't seem that faceless names with copied sentences over and over again warrants enough merit. A bulk of the comments in both cases are less focused on constructive criticism and more on stating opposition. For reviewers, taking these comments into account doesn't necessarily mean adjusting the proposal. While they [are obligated](https://www.regulations.gov/docs/FactSheet_Public_Comments_Make_a_Difference.pdf) to categorize and respond to comments, the agencies have already decided on the action to take.

The process is messy. Posted comments isn't the same thing as being in the room with agency members, debating solutions and alternatives. It may already be a foregone conclusion during the commenting period. Yet this is indicative to a larger issue: involvement in democracy is frequently limited to expression. Go vote. Make a catchy slogan for the protest sign. Post a comment. Share an article on a social network. We're dissatisfied, and we're making that clear. Isn't that enough?  
Regulation.gov's motto is "Make a difference. Submit your comments and let your voice be heard." Yet in the site's own recommendations on comments, it's clear that *what* you are saying is more important your voice in-itself. It's not worth speaking if you have nothing worthy to say. In a culture that glorifies expression, our subjective measures of worth are declining. We've shifted from a silent majority to a palavering crowd.

To some extent, the public comment process reinforces the notion of expression for the sake of expression. It doesn't extol conversation among one another, nor back-and-forth with public officials. Participation in democracy is not expression, but creation, action, and self-improvement.
