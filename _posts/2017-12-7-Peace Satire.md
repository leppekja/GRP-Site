title: Other things we keep doing that haven't brought Peace (satire)
---
["After more than two decades of waivers,](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-israel-speech-transcript.html) we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result."<!--excerpt-->

*Maybe we should also try not:*

Intentionally aggravating the parties involved.

Encouraging peace agreements. Thanks for nothing, Clinton. 

Giving Israel hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid and billions of sales in military equipment while allowing settlement expansion.

Educating people.

Living.
