An ongoing post: Seeing social innovation in action. <!--excerpt-->

I recently had a paper accepted for a conference focusing on Collaborative Innovation Networks (COINS) in a context of community and economic development. Being interested in the subject, I've decided to create an ongoing list of *rough* examples that correlate with the spirit of innovation through communities online.

[Innocentive](https://www.innocentive.com/): Challenge-driven, crowd-sourced.

[Patronicity](https://www.patronicity.com/): Crowd-sourced community grants.

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/): World's largest funding platform.

[ConnectMichiganAlliance](http://ourstateofgenerosity.org/project/connectmichigan-alliance/): No longer operating. However, interesting project recap.

[Mentor Michigan](http://www.michigan.gov/mentormichigan/): Network for Mentoring Organizations. While not very active in the past few years, the network should be revitalized in 2018.

[Michigan Nonprofit Association](https://www.mnaonline.org/): Speaks for itself.

[Lichess](https://lichess.org/): Personal Favorite chess site, developed online through a network. Completely open-source, and high quality compared to its competition. It's not related to community/economic development at all... but I highly recommend it.

[Michigan Community Service Commission](http://www.michigan.gov/mcsc/): Currently not a COIN, but has plans to develop networks in the near future to spur volunteerism. My current place of employment, so hopefully I can have some impact on shaping these networks.
