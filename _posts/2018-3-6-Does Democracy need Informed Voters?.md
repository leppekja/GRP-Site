title: Does Democracy need Well-Informed Voters?
---
"Democracy depends on an educated and well informed citizenry, the voter." But does it? <!--excerpt-->

In the comments of [David Brook's op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/opinion/the-chaos-after-trump.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region) today, the above quote was repeated everywhere. Democracy depends on informed voters. This sentiment is everywhere, used as evidence for declining trust in government, increasing polarization, and "the other side is the devil" arguments. 

But is it right?

David Brooks doesn't mention it. Neither do Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, authors of [How Democracies Die](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562246/how-democracies-die-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/9781524762933/), in a few interviews I've read from them, [here](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2018/jan/21/this-is-how-democracies-die) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems). Excuse my skepticism, but I have a difficult time believing that previous American generations were actually better informed than we are now. Less attention should be paid to what people say and think, and more on what they do.

What is clear is that democracy depends on how voters act, and these acts are governed by formal and informal institutions. It does not matter if a voter comprehends every position that a politician has before voting for him or her, as long as the voter participates according to democratic ideals. It does not matter if the voter is informed as long as the voter is willing to compromise, or willing to be polite and live side by side with those he or she disagrees with. It matters that voters have the "right" information to act on; "right" meaning consistent with democratic ideals. Those who consume and believe 'fake' news are informed - just inaccurately. 

Stability, I'd argue, is not the logical conclusion of an informed citizenry, but of acting as one. Democracies, as such, are inherently unstable; at their strongest, they are usually united against a common enemy, and thus, lose some of what makes them democratic (as seen in McCarthyism, war on Terrorism, within the ongoing political tribalization). The ability to be tolerant, or preferably, be compassionate toward those who the voter does not align themselves with. 

Sure, education - ideally - allows citizens to perceive events more accurately and make better decisions. But plenty of conservative, liberals, libertarians, and communists have advanced degrees and disagree with each other. I'm not saying that education doesn't reinforce the structure of society, but arguing that the decay of democracy is attributed to the fact that some people are smart and some people are not as smart is not compelling in any way. What is more important is how people act toward one another.

Really, what I'm curious in, is what is the minimal level of informed-ness that voters need? I'd agree that an education is necessary to take full advantage of the benefits of living in a democracy, but regarding its functioning, I'm not convinced that better-informed voters are the key, as much as I'd like it to be. It's much simpler to provide knowledge than correct action, as everybody who has ever tried to start a habit that supposedly makes their life better/healthier. 

“The health of a democratic society may be measured by the quality of functions performed by private citizens.” - [Alexis de Tocqueville](http://www.ishlt.org/ContentDocuments/2015FebLinks_EdCorner.html)
