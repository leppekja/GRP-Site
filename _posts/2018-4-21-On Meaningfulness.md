title: On Meaningfulness; A Recap
---

Thursday, 4/20/2018. On Meaningfulness <!--excerpt-->

We spoke, last night, on meaningfulness. The following is a brief recapitulation of what we discussed. Hopefully I've accurately restated various arguments and provided them with their best justifications; if not, feel free to reach out at grplansing@gmail.com to request an adjustment. Interjections of comments are marked within em dashes. 

The intent of these written follow-ups is to connect a few key statements from our conversations to previous philosophical work directly. For those interested, it will help place current thought within the history of philosophy and connect you with further resources that will clarify/refute thoughts. Let me know if it is helpful/not, or if the format should be adjusted.

We largely didn't focus on the why of meaningfulness. Most of us either accepted an existing meaning or created their own, almost as if meaning was an implicit component to life. Perhaps it is, depending on your beliefs. Or meaning is necessary to life, or I'm overthinking it. But it remains a question: why do we want to live meaningful lives? Why is meaning significant? It's an issue, because the variations in our responses to 'what is' often fall away when asked why that is. It's simple, I think, to come to an answer through experience; even asking the question to yourself brings the answer to mind quickly. From this, it's more important to ask: how do we come to a meaning, or, how do we evaluate various meanings, as individuals?

Imagine standing next to a deep river with a strong current and churning rapids, lost in a forest so thick with trees that you can't possibly walk through it, and being stalked by hungry wolves. Standing alone, each of us would have different responses. Some of us would think we are trapped, accept our fate, and be eaten. The rest of us would realize that we have the option to jump into the river, and be instantly anxious: what if I drowned, where will it take me, what's in the river, maybe there is another option. Of this group, some of us would be paralyzed with anxiety until we were eaten by wolves. Some of us would reason that drowning is better than being eaten by wolves, closing our eyes and jumping in with no intention of surviving. Still, some of us - hopefully, faithfully, and steadfastly - would trust that the river would lead us to safety just around the bend, and jump in. Some would stand and fight the wolves - thinking ourselves to be valiant - and die. Some would pick the river after rational consideration, and swim toward what looked like a safe alcove on the opposite bank, our arms thrashing every second against the current as we struggled to maintain our course, our failure imminent as we lost strength. And the last of us would step purposefully in the river, lay back, and let our bodies be carried by the current until we hit rocks, taking advantage of every moment of air. 

Despite describing all the outcomes - which are all the same - of each decision, the focus is really in the moment of decision. I'm curious to what we decide, but more importantly how each person decided. My best answer is (succinctly) *perceived* existential comfort in response to suffering. This question is [more elegantly and famously addressed here!](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~freeman/courses/phil360/16.%20Myth%20of%20Sisyphus.pdf#page=23&zoom=auto,-99,731) It's an individual's perception of life that informs their chosen meaning, and it's difficult to have a group discussion where we can delve into this, unfortunately, simply due to format constraints. Regardless, I enjoyed Thursday's discussion, and am looking forward to seeing everyone next week.

**w/r/t Meaningfulness**

The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.

*[Context helps](https://wwnorton.com/college/history/america-essential-learning/docs/HDThoreau-Walden-1854.pdf#page=3&zoom=auto,-99,278). My best understanding of this: as humans, conscious of our own experience and aware of our death, anxiety is [intrinsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concept_of_Anxiety) to Being. We seek, unfailingly and desperately, for a remedy. Thoreau's actions in Walden, an inquiry for life's necessities, are a rejection of the typical solutions (e.g. fulfillment of our desires) we look to. His words, then, indicate a common [affliction](http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/TheSicknessUntoDeath.pdf) of modern times: the spiritual recognition without the acceptance of religion has made us increasingly aware of our consciousness, or spirit, without accounting for its reason for being. Life is suffering, and much of our lives is spent on daily, insignificant matters or purposeful distractions. We place our attention not on what it is like to be, but on extraneous aspects of existence. Simply, living simply, for Thoreau, meant attention is focused on what is happening by [minimizing possibilities](https://philosophizethis.libsyn.com/079-kierkegaard-on-anxiety).*

Meaning is in the journey, not the destination.

*Reminds me of [Into The Wild](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/). This is a good point to examine carefully. Implicit here is how you conduct yourself on the journey to somewhere, which is a perfectly fine consideration to take into account. However, it [begs the question](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/begs-the-question-update). It allows us to sidestep the worthiness, if that means anything, of the destination; moreover, it doesn't address the actual virtues/principles that one bases their conduct throughout the journey on. It does, though, reorient the question to reflect life's dynamic nature. That's important, but not enough.*

The Universe is conscious through us, so it's valuable to experience as much as possible, and pay attention to that experience.

*This depends on if I wrote down the wording correctly, so I'll offer two interpretations. If it's correct as written and you accept current scientific understanding of how humans evolved, i.e., a sort of materialism, then it depends on how you define consciousness to decide whether it is correct or not. See [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/opinion/sunday/are-we-really-conscious.html), [here](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/03/13/the-consciousness-deniers/), or [here](https://samharris.org/the-mystery-of-consciousness/) for a viewpoint. Being aware of your own personal experience is important, absolutely. Of course, the comment could be referring to [cosmopsychism](https://aeon.co/essays/cosmopsychism-explains-why-the-universe-is-fine-tuned-for-life), the idea that the everything in the universe is conscious. Weirdly, a [mathematical explanation](https://www.wired.com/story/tricky-business-of-measuring-consciousness/) for consciousness actually suggests this may be the case.*

Life's meaning, or purpose, is to help others.

*Compelling point. If purposefully inflicting pain is evil, the direct opposite is alleviating the pain of others.* 

Of course, good is the [opposite of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_and_Evil), right?

We often find [meaning through belonging](https://www.spring.org.uk/2013/10/sense-of-belonging-increases-meaningfulness-of-life.php), as well as our general engagement with others.

*[The Social Animal](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Animal-Sources-Character-Achievement/dp/0812979370) is worth reading, but a TED talk (which I haven’t seen) can be [found here](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_brooks_the_social_animal).*

We occasionally have issues with people who ‘know’ the meaning of their lives, whether that be through dogmatism, ideology, or other forms. The apparent clash between modern scientific theories and major religions.

*Common issue, I think. How do different understandings of life interact with one another? [The Brothers Karamazov](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28054?msg=welcome_stranger) brilliantly communicates this. The relationship between the [individual and society](http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FreudS-CIVILIZATION-AND-ITS-DISCONTENTS-text-final.pdf)? A conversation we’ll have in the future.*

Questions mentioned but left unresolved:

- Are meaning and purpose the same concept?
- To what extent is meaning culturally imposed?
- How is the search for meaning informed by biology?
- Why does experience have value?
- Is meaning just a state of comfort?
- Are there valid and invalid meanings? 
- Can we consider meaning without contemplating death, explicitly or not?
- Why do we have meaning whereas animals don’t, or why do we not ascribe animals ‘meanings’ or ‘purposes’?
- How are conflicting meanings mediated in society?
- Should meaning be considered as an individual, or in relation to others/the Earth?
