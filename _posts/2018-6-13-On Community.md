title: On Community; A Discussion
---
Thursday, 6/13/2018, 6:30 PM <!--excerpt-->

We spoke, last night, on community. The following is a brief recapitulation of what we discussed. Hopefully I've accurately restated various arguments and provided them with their best justifications; if not, feel free to reach out at grplansing@gmail.com to request an adjustment. Interjections of comments are marked within em dashes.

The intent of these written follow-ups is to connect a few key statements from our conversations to previous philosophical work directly. For those interested, it will help place current thought within the history of philosophy and connect you with further resources that will clarify/refute thoughts. Let me know if it is helpful/not, or if the format should be adjusted.
Sorry that this summary is more stream-of-consciousness style than those previous.

A few general principles of [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community) we seemed to agree on:
- sense of shared belonging
- shared trust
- interdependence, sense of responsibility, of attachment
- shared traits(?)

Are communities, then, identified externally or internally? How would we recognize community if its supposed members did not accept the community label, or vice versa? Where would disagreements like this arise? How does community change, in terms of values, norms, or actual size?

Two senses of expansion here: one, wider (encompassing more people), and two, increased connection between people (deeper relationships). There are levels of integration into a community. How does this occur i.e. how does acceptance work within groups? Are tribes and communities synonyms within modern usage, or where do they differ? With respect to this, community seems to foster an in/out divide. Is there such a thing as maximum amount of diversity, defined broadly, within a community, or in other words, where are the limits to community, whether they are physical e.g. spatial or psychological e.g. trust, if any do exist?

This brings to mind the increasing presence of online communities. Differences between these and in-person interactions? Seems to solve issues around geography’s effects on community, as well as increased mobility. Increased globalization and advances in communications technology has decreased the limitations of physical distance. Communities coalesce, seemingly, around issues. Imagine, perhaps, individuals floating around a lake. A whirlpool, or a community, dependent on some force, forms, bringing people together around a certain point. Distance increases in between these individuals and others away from the whirlpool. These individuals are caught, to some extent, amid the force of the water and directed by its flows. Moreover, near the epicenter of the drain, vertical gaps would appear in between community members as they are pulled down, bringing the theory of small differences to mind.

Community as an extension of society with increased rules and norms. Is community chosen? Imposed? Is one better or worse? Does this affect how community is responded to by the individuals within it? How have the Amish and other intentional communities retained their traditional practices? How do intentional communities differ from found or imposed communities? How does a sense of community affect power structures within groups of people? 

What denotes a healthy community? Healthy community dependent on healthy people? Nostalgia for community of the 1950s – things were simply kept hidden more, yet exceedingly difficult to characterize this mode of community as any better with the exception of certain demographics e.g. white middle-class males. If we examine community on longer time scales (past 10,000 years or so, but subject to revision on that number), how does this affect our conception of community? Certainly, the perception of community within the United States, according to popular opinion, has been declining, but that may need to be broken out to examine how different demographics react to characterizations of community over time. Has community increased in certain places?

Alcoholics Anonymous as a community – reminds me of [Infinite Jest’s take on this subject](https://infiniteboston.blogspot.com/2015/06/this-is-chapter-about-boston-aa-from.html).

Restrictions on being shape being. Communities are norms, limiting the individual, and reducing us to certain societal norms, especially in small-sized communities. It structures social interactions, provides knowledge about others – stories about people simplify social interaction e.g. the role of gossip. Education as a means to maintain community, it acts as a social grooming mechanic of what is appropriate. 

How resilient is community? How does it respond to shocks/disruptions? Increased stress? This is unclear – especially w/r/t current events. Community interactions – repeated games within game theory. Participants perceive greatest benefits through cooperation. If community declines due to decreased perceived need for long term cooperation, what replaces structures to enforce this e.g. government, norms, social media? How does money facilitate relationships?

Enduring Questions
- How do we rank the needs of the individuals against the needs of the community?
- What engenders a sense of community? Where does this semblance of belonging emerge from?
- How do value systems of a community affect an individual’s personal sense of ethics and morality?
