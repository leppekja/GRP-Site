title: Collective Intelligence & Identity
---
"a collective intelligence that dissolves the boundaries of the self..." -[Geoff Mulgan, Nautilus](http://nautil.us/blog/collective-intelligence-will-end-identity_based-politics) <!--excerpt-->

In a Nautilus article entitled, *Collective Intelligence Will End Identity-based Politics*, Mulgan doesn't explain how collective intelligence will end identity-based politics. Not even close. He broadly describes the notion of collective intelligence and why it's significant over time, but he wavers between concepts of intelligence, wisdom, and consciousness, instead choosing to focus the brunt of his argument on why any attempt to explain the development of human consciousness is flawed, and any prediction is erroneous. 

It's an excerpt from a [forthcoming book](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11098.html), which makes sense, because the article is poorly written for this format. It touches on a number of interesting points, but with few citations to further reading, no clear thesis, I'm interested in perusing the book for a better understanding. In the abstract for the book, collective intelligence is apparently described as "human and machine capabilities working together," which isn't the focus of the article.

At best, we can say that the author attempts to show why any predictions of what collective intelligence will look like in the future are not accurate. He concludes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
"No reliable theory for the evolution of consciousness is feasible, since it would emerge from a culture and consciousness less developed than the one it attempted to explain, and could only be proven right or wrong over long periods of time. But it is possible to imagine, explore, and promote forms of consciousness that enhance awareness as well as dissolve the artificial illusions of self and separate identity."</p>

It is a stunningly pointless conclusion, and I'm wary of misunderstanding his intention here - even the first sentence is confusing: if a reliable theory isn't feasible, why does he even describe the theory as reliable in the first place? If he meant feasible in terms of predicting the future, he instantly contradicts himself by pointing out that it can be proven right or wrong. It's a theory, not an definitive answer. If a reliable theory for the evolution is considered fallible since it emerged from a less evolved consciousness, why should imagining a higher form of consciousness be any more worthwhile? Moreover, it seems obvious that no theory of consciousness for the future could be reliable if it depends on the fusing of man and machinery. Couldn't a higher form of consciousness develop a feasible theory for the evolution of consciousness? The author also seems to confuse notions of intelligence with society in the second section of the article. He promotes a dialectical approach early on and quickly abandons it, questioning the ability of the method to make sense of any casual mechanisms for societal differences.

While disparaging any evolutionary theory of consciousness, he promotes certain ideas himself, ones that he apparently finds to be obvious.

"Yet it doesn’t take much reflection to remember that throughout history, changes in the quantity of calculation or intelligence are always accompanied by changes in quality—changes in how we think as well as what thinking does. These brought us new ways of seeing the world, such as the idea of a world ruled by scientific laws, not magic, people as sovereign citizens, humans depending on a global ecosystem, or selves as composite, contingent, and partly illusory.

It follows that any future changes to intelligence will similarly combine quantity and quality. History tells us of just such transitions: the passage to larger scale and more comprehensive forms of state; the rise of civility, with cultures able to interact with strangers in cities; and the reductions in violence, as measured by mortality statistics and also everyday encounters."</p>

He seems to be implying that general thoughts about the future of consciousness are perfectly fine, but any detail on the subject isn't worthy of our time...this, coming from a person who wrote a book on the topic. He links the quantity of intelligence - which is a questionable measure that he doesn't discuss - to how society is organized. His assumptions seem tenuous, since plenty of current societies do not regard people as sovereign citizens, many believe in religion or other unsubstantiated claims, and disregard global warming as a phenomenon. Why he imagines these general thoughts, as expressed in this article, are of any value or insightful, I'm not sure. 

Perhaps, of course, I completely misunderstood the excerpt, so I plan to pick up the book to read what I'm missing.
