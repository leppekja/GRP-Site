Our Theory of Change <!--excerpt-->

**1.	Who are you seeking to influence or benefit (target population)?**

Grassroots Philosophy (GRP) aims to benefit community members that share any of these defining characteristics:

1.	Those with a general interest in questions of philosophical nature but lack formal training or learning resources. This target population enjoys casual discussion of philosophy in a safe, informed environment during a discussion that transcends traditional political boundaries.
2.	Youth aged 18-24 that have limited interest in philosophy due to lack of exposure in formal educational environments. 
3.	A Sense of alienation, loneliness, and decreased social capital that affects their general mood. This target population recognizes a lack of spiritual fulfillment in their lives which they seek to correct through engaging with philosophy. 
4.	Broadly identified, individuals without philosophical training for which political, social, and/or cultural beliefs are perceived to be integral to maintaining self-identity, and therefore, precluding their ability to change their minds, empathize, and engage in critical self-reflection.

All of these target populations share one common characteristic: a lack of formal study in philosophy. Formal study is defined as extended study at the collegiate or post-graduate levels in a classroom setting. General interest readers of philosophy do not fall under this category. While professional philosophers, or those with formal philosophical training, are welcome to attend discussions, participate in group activities, and make contributions to GRP content, the primary emphasis is on community members with limited or no experience in Socratic discussion and philosophy.

**2.	What benefits are you seeking to achieve (results)?**

Grassroots Philosophy aims to combat three correlated trends:

1)	Growing sense of alienation and spiritual unfulfillment.
2)	Decreased social capital and community engagement and rising levels of loneliness and depression.
3)	Increased political polarization and limited critical engagement with philosophical questions.

Grassroots Philosophy results in an active network of community members that creates opportunities for in-person activities oriented around meaningful social connections and idea-sharing. It provides a safe environment for learning that is removed from contentious and topical political debates. It increases the social capital of community members. It heightens the level of discourse through encouraging friendly conversation and the challenging of common assumptions.

4. How will you and others make this happen (activities, strategies, resources, etc.)?

Grassroots Philosophy will accomplish the goals laid out in section (2) through adapting the traditional grassroots movement model of change. Grassroots Philosophy can be understood as a convener, facilitator, and resource generator as demonstrated by fig. (1).

GRP’s foundation is in weekly discussion groups organized for community members. This alone will accomplish the primary goal of spreading philosophy in casual settings within communities through conversation. These meetings are organized around a single topic each week, meant to build a bridge from personal experience to wider philosophical concepts. Previous topics have been love, community, happiness, redemption, and creativity. All topics are specifically chosen to retain accessibility while encouraging abstract exploration. These meetings are an hour and a half long, with a 3-5 minute introduction to the topic. 

GRP would like to extend learning and discussion past the weekly discussion groups. This will be accomplished through the development of a yearly event focused on larger gatherings and network building, as well as online resources. With the multitude of learning resources available online, GRP acts as an aggregator, promoting the best learning content online to its members. These resources are disseminated through a weekly newsletter. Partnerships with learning institutions and community organizations allows for the access to learning resources and expert knowledge. 

As the existence and success of Grassroots Philosophy revolves around the participation of community members, GRP’s marketing strategy is focused on broad-based, community level messaging. MeetUp and the GRP website serve as online hubs for planning purposes and resource banks. Flyers posted at local gathering spots and word-of-mouth sharing improves name recognition and attendance. 

**5. Where and under what circumstances will you do your work (context)?**

Grassroots Philosophy is a community-level initiative. The discussions take place in a time of declining civic engagement, heightened [political polarization](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/), and the apparent disregarding of philosophical questions in favor of political action. It is meant as a tool to demonstrate that thoughtful discussion between a diverse group of people is indeed possible, as well as to give individuals awareness of their implicit assumptions and biases. It happens in popular community gathering spots, reintroducing the idea that philosophy is meant for the public and not confined to academics and libraries.

**6. Why do you believe your theory will bear out (assumptions)?**

The foundational belief of Grassroots Philosophy is that a large barrier to productive dialogue is the external conditions, i.e., inability to meet in-person, no social connections with opposing viewpoints, inappropriate atmosphere for conversation, tribal influences, and/or lack of facilitation. The implicit condition here is that a critical mass of individuals, in conducive conversational settings, are willing to engage productively with their own beliefs to spur larger social adjustment.  Essentially, Grassroots Philosophy is a safe space for dialogue, a model that has been relied on throughout history in education, psychology, and philosophy. 

Dialogue is essential for [learning](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/02/03/why-kids-now-more-than-ever-need-to-learn-philosophy-yes-philosophy/?utm_term=.0045cc81ccf8). Conversation engenders compassion and understanding of [varied viewpoints]( https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/988). Discussion groups also create resilient [social norms](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/) around conversation and community participation. Philosophy is [implicit](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=public+philosophy&ots=jIs-VWlpSE&sig=PLUCtEWjiVHwB-7HjjtiaBePF7Y#v=onepage&q=public%20philosophy&f=false) within our everyday ideals and practices. Change continues to confront individuals, waging assault on many long-held beliefs, and it is critical that individuals are able to grapple with these issues productively. Mass market online philosophy videos are limited in their effectiveness. 

[Social interaction](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evil-deeds/201402/lets-talk-about-loneliness-alienation-in-linked-age) is still an [integral part](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/well/live/having-friends-is-good-for-you.html) of mental health. Meaningful conversations alleviate feelings of loneliness, a [rising and dangerous](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/17/loneliness-report-bigger-killer-obesity-lonely-people) phenomenon. By creating a channel for individuals to join community events, participation in GRP diminishes the sense of alienation. It allows for the adoption of a minimal group identity without [negative effects](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/is-america/201803/group-dienamics-the-perils-identity-politics).

Overall, Grassroots Philosophy is an effective voluntary intervention for people interested in obtaining meaningful conversation and social interaction.
