Community & economic development starts from within.
</b></p>
Rather than pursue international development (my undergraduate focus), I’m starting in Michigan, the place I know best. My current interest is creating diverse collaborative resource networks. Whether those are online or in-person, developing content-sharing partnerships allows for a more comprehensive approach to development – a must for Michigan. My experience working with various nonprofits, community programs, and economic development centers allows me to achieve effective capacity building through networking, online promotion, and program development. Read through my blog to see some highlights of Michigan’s development, promising start-ups, and community initiatives that you should know about.

<p align="center"><b> Bio </b></p>

After growing up in the Tri-City region, studying in East Lansing, and working in Detroit and the Greater Lansing Area, I’ve seen the multitude of issues Michigan is forced to confront. Yet in the post-2008 revitalization process, I’ve witnessed (and participated in) some brilliant and unique solutions that solve local, regional, and state problems. I’d like to continue this work and contribute to the communities, businesses, and governments that have provided me with scholarships, professional experience, and engaging experiences.
